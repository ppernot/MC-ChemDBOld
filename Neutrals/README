2019-05-29 : 	* Changed model for trimolecular reactions from Troe to Kadduct, according to Dobrijevic2016/Loison 
		  Affects genSamples.R and plotRates.R 
		* Unified mass calculations by use of massCalc.R (same as in Ions)
		* Created kinParse.R to unify DB files reading in scripts
		* Added reactions for O chemistry, mostly based on Vuitton2019 and KIDA
		* Added Fc column in trimolecular data files

2020-06-23 : 	* v1.2
		* Introduced updates in Hickson2020 (A kinetic study of the N(2D)+ C2H4 
               	reaction at low temperature)
