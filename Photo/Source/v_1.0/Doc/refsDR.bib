	of around 400-. We identify a broad transition region between SZA
	50o and 100o, where the ionosphere of Titan changes from being entirely
	sunlit to being in the shadow of the moon. For SZA <50o the ionisation
	peak altitude increases with increasing SZA, whereas the transition
	region and the nightside show more scattered ionospheric peak altitudes.
	Typical electron temperatures at the ionospheric peak are 0.03-0.06 eV

  abstract = {Energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) are formed when singly charged magnetospheric
	ions undergo charge exchange with exospheric neutral atoms. The energy
	of the incident ions is almost entirely transferred to the charge
	exchange produced ENAs, which then propagate along nearly rectilinear
	ballistic trajectories. Thus the ENAs can be used like \"photons\"
	in order to form an image of the energetic ion distribution. The
	Cassini spacecraft will be equipped with INCA, a magnetospheric imaging
	energetic neutral atom camera [Mitchell et al., 1993]. In this context,
	we undertook the study of the energetic neutral atom prodn. resulting
	from the interaction of Titan's exosphere with Saturn's magnetosphere.
	This necessitated the development of a model for the altitude d.
	profile and compn. of both the inner and the outer exosphere of Titan.
	We used the Chamberlain model for the inner exosphere (altitude <
	6000 km) that included the five major species: H, H2, N, N2, and
	CH4. In the lower part of the exosphere, where our model overlaps
	the high altitude end of existing lower atm. models, the results
	are compatible. The d. and compn. profiles obtained from our model
	were then used to calc. the ENA prodn., considering a proton spectrum
	measured by Voyager in the Saturnian magnetosphere as the parent
	ion population. It is shown how the exospheric species contribute
	in a different way, as a function of the altitude, to the ENA flux
	spectra. In the outer exosphere (altitude > 6000 km), mol. hydrogen
	is the dominant species, and we utilized a Chamberlain model to est.
	the ENA intensities several Titan radii from the moon. The Titan
	exosphere is nearly as bright in ENA as the inner magnetosphere of
	Saturn, making it possible to image the exosphere out to at least
	5 Titan radii, and even to resolve it when the spacecraft is several
	Saturn radii distant from the moon. Our results also show that the
	magnetospheric imaging technique via energetic neutral atom detection
	is a powerful diagnostic tool for the interaction of Saturn's magnetosphere
	with Titan and for the remote sensing of the compn. profile of Titan's
	exosphere. [on SciFinder (R)]},

  abstract = {Methane is key to sustaining Titan's thick nitrogen atmosphere. However,
	methane is destroyed and converted to heavier hydrocarbons irreversibly
	on a relatively short timescale of approximately 10-100 million years.
	Without the warming provided by CH4-generated hydrocarbon hazes in
	the stratosphere and the pressure induced opacity in the infrared,
	particularly by CH4-N2 and H2-N2 collisions in the troposphere, the
	atmosphere could be gradually reduced to as low as tens of millibar
	pressure. An understanding of the source-sink cycle of methane is
	thus crucial to the evolutionary history of Titan and its atmosphere.
	In this paper we propose that a complex photochemical-meteorological-hydrogeochemical
	cycle of methane operates on Titan. We further suggest that although
	photochemistry leads to the loss of methane from the atmosphere,
	conversion to a global ocean of ethane is unlikely. The behavior
	of methane in the troposphere and the surface, as measured by the
	Cassini-Huygens gas chromatograph mass spectrometer, together with
	evidence of cryovolcanism reported by the Cassini visual and infrared
	mapping spectrometer, represents a "methalogical" cycle on Titan,
	somewhat akin to the hydrological cycle on Earth. In the absence
	of net loss to the interior, it would represent a closed cycle. However,
	a source is still needed to replenish the methane lost to photolysis.
	A hydrogeochemical source deep in the interior of Titan holds promise.
	It is well known that in serpentinization, hydration of ultramafic
	silicates in terrestrial oceans produces H2(aq), whose reaction with
	carbon grains or carbon dioxide in the crustal pores produces methane
	gas. Appropriate geological, thermal, and pressure conditions could
	have existed in and below Titan's purported water-ammonia ocean for
	"low-temperature" serpentinization to occur in Titan's accretionary
	heating phase. On the other hand, impacts could trigger the process
	at high temperatures. In either instance, storage of methane as a
	stable clathrate-hydrate in Titan's interior for later release to
	the atmosphere is quite plausible. There is also some likelihood
	that the production of methane on Titan by serpentinization is a
	gradual and continuous on-going process.},

	Interpretation of the C2H2 d. profile with photochem. models leads
	to a value of (5 - 10) * 103 cm2s-1 for the eddy diffusion coeff.
	(Kh) at the Uranus homopause, which for these limits of Kh corresponds
	to 354 km (0.037 mb) and 390 km (0.02 mb) above the 1-bar level.
	The eddy coeff. derived from these globally averaged observations
	is found to be in agreement with the values obtained by Voyager for
	the equatorial-low latitudes ten years earlier. The ISO-Voyager consistency
	in Kh indicates that whatever little manifestable internal energy
	Uranus possesses may still be adequate and responsible for controlling
	the behavior of vertical mixing in its visible atm., and that the
	dynamical behavior of the upper atm. is fairly uniform over the planet.
	In Dec. 1997, Me radicals (CH3) were also detected by ISO/SWS in
	the atm. of Saturn. The derived stratospheric column abundance of
	CH3, (1.5-7.5) * 1013 cm-2, is about a factor of 10 smaller than
	the predictions of methane photochem. models, however. The discrepancy
	could be explained by one of two means: either the value of the eddy
	diffusion coeff. used in the models - the Voyager value - is too
	high by at least a factor of 100, or the rate const. for the self-reaction
	loss of CH3 is too low by at least a factor of 10. It is argued that
	Kh could not possibly be reduced so drastically from the Voyager
	epoch. Instead, we believe the source of the discrepancy between
	the ISO derived CH3 and the model calcns. lies in the poor knowledge
	of lab. chem. kinetics data on certain CH3 loss reactions, which
	has serious implications for the interpretation of observations of
	atmospheres of the giant planets and Titan. [on SciFinder (R)]},

	is a causal connection between the motion of the Sun through the
	Galaxy and terrestrial mass extinctions or climate change. Proposed
	mechanisms include comet impacts (via perturbation of the Oort cloud),
	cosmic rays and supernovae, the effects of which are modulated by
	the passage of the Sun through the Galactic midplane or spiral arms.
	Supposed periodicities in the fossil record, impact cratering dates
	or climate proxies over the Phanerozoic (past 545 Myr) are frequently
	cited as evidence in support of these hypotheses. This remains a
	controversial subject, with many refutations and replies having been
	published. Here I review both the mechanisms and the evidence for
	and against the relevance of astronomical phenomena to climate change
	and evolution. This necessarily includes a critical assessment of
	time series analysis techniques and hypothesis testing. Some of the
	studies have suffered from flaws in methodology, in particular drawing
	incorrect conclusions based on ruling out a null hypothesis. I conclude
	that there is little evidence for intrinsic periodicities in biodiversity,
	impact cratering or climate on timescales of tens to hundreds of
	Myr. Although this does not rule out the mechanisms, the numerous
	assumptions and uncertainties involved in the interpretation of the
	geological data and in particular in the astronomical mechanisms
	suggest that Galactic midplane and spiral arm crossings have little
	impact on biological or climate variation above background level.
	Non-periodic impacts and terrestrial mechanisms (volcanism, plate
	tectonics, sea level changes), possibly occurring simultaneously,
	remain likely causes of many environmental catastrophes. Internal
	dynamics of the biosphere may also play a role. In contrast, there
	is little evidence supporting the idea that cosmic rays have a significant
	influence on climate through cloud formation. It seems likely that
	more than one mechanism has contributed to biodiversity variations

	suggests a vertical distribution of CO nearly constant at this value
	from the surface throughout the troposphere to at least the stratopause
	near 300 km altitude. The corresponding total atmospheric content
	of CO in Titan is ~2.9+/-1.5x1014 kg. Given the long lifetime of
	CO in the oxygen-poor Titan atmosphere (~0.5-1.0 Gyr), we find a
	mean CO atmospheric production rate of 6+/-3x105 kg yr-1. Given the
	lack of primordial heavy noble gases observed by Huygens [Niemann
	et al., 2005. The abundances of constituents of Titan's atmosphere
	from the GCMS on the Huygens probe. Nature, 438, 779-784], the primary
	source of atmospheric CO is likely surface emissions. The implied
	CO/CH4 mixing ratio of near-surface material is 1.8+/-0.9x10-4, based
	on an average methane surface emission rate over the past 0.5 Gyr
	of 1.3x10-13 gm cm-2 s-1 as required to balance hydrocarbon haze
	production via methane photolysis [Wilson and Atreya, 2004. Current
	state of modeling the photochemistry of Titan's mutually dependent
	atmosphere and ionosphere. J. Geophys. Res. 109, E06002 Doi:10.1029/2003JE002181].
	This low CO/CH4 ratio is much lower than expected for the sub-nebular
	formation region of Titan and supports the hypothesis [e.g., Atreya
	et al., 2005. Methane on Titan: photochemical-meteorological-hydrogeochemical
	cycle. Bull. Am. Astron. Soc. 37, 735] that the conversion of primordial
	CO and other carbon-bearing materials into CH4-enriched clathrate-hydrates
	occurs within the deep interior of Titan via the release of hydrogen
	through the serpentinization process followed by Fischer-Tropsch
	catalysis. The time-averaged predicted emission rate of methane-rich
	surface materials is ~0.02 km3 yr-1, a value significantly lower
	than the rate of silicate lava production for the Earth and Venus,
	but nonetheless indicative of significant active geological processes
	reshaping the surface of Titan.},

  abstract = {A time-dependent microphys. model is used to study the evolution of
	ethane ice clouds in Titan's atm. The model simulates nucleation,
	condensational growth, evapn., coagulation, and transport of particles.
	For a crit. satn. of 1.15 (a lower limit, detd. by lab. expts.),
	we find that ethane clouds can be sustained between altitudes of
	8 and 50 km. Growth due to coalescence is inefficient, limiting the
	peak in the size distribution (by no.) to 10 mm. These clouds vary
	with a period of about 20 days. This periodicity disappears for higher
	crit. satn. values where clouds remain subvisible. Rainout of ethane
	due to methane cloud formation raises the altitude of the ethane
	cloud bottom to near the tropopause and may eliminate ethane clouds
	entirely if methane cloud formation occurs up to 30 km. However,
	clouds formed above the troposphere from other gases in Titan's atm.
	could be sustained even with rainout up to 30 km. Although the optical
	depth of ethane clouds above 20 km is typically low, short-lived
	clouds with optical depths of order 0.1-1 can be created sporadically
	by dynamically driven atm. cooling. Ethane cloud particles larger
	than 25 mm can fall to the surface before total evapn. However, ethane
	clouds remain only a small sink for tholin particles. At the peak
	of their cycle, the optical depth of ethane clouds could be comparable
	to that of tholin in the near-IR, resulting in a 5% increase in Titan's
	albedo for wavelengths between 1 and 2 mm. A no. of factors limit
	our ability to predict the ethane cloud properties. These factors

	resonances delineated at thousands of energies, are taken from the
	Opacity Project database TOPbase and the Iron Project, including
	new data for the low ionization stages of iron Fe I -Fe V . The resonance-averaged
	cross sections are obtained by convolving the detailed cross sections
	with a Gaussian distribution over the autoionizing resonances. This
	procedure is expected to minimize errors in the derived ionization
	rates that could result from small uncertainties in computed positions
	of resonances while preserving the overall resonant contribution
	to the cross sections in the important near-threshold regions. The
	detailed photoionization cross sections at low photon energies are
	complemented by new relativistic distorted-wave calculations for
	Z â¤ 12 and from central-field calculations for Z > 12 at high energies,
	including inner shell ionization. The effective cross sections are
	then represented by a small number of points that can be readily
	interpolated linearly for practical applications; a FORTRAN subroutine
	and data are available. The present numerically averaged cross sections
	are compared with analytic fits that do not accurately represent
	the effective cross sections in regions dominated by resonances.},

  abstract = {Reactive plasmas are a well-known tool for material synthesis and

	electron and ion driven plasma chemistry, energetic ions accelerated
	in the plasma sheath at the plasmaâsurface interface, high fluxes
	of reactive species towards surfaces and a friendly environment for
	thermolabile objects. Additionally, small negatively charged clusters
	can be generated, because they are confined in the positive plasma
	potential. Plasmas in hydrocarbon gases, and especially in acetylene,
	are a good example for the discussion of different plasma-chemical
	processes. These plasmas are involved in a plethora of possible applications
	ranging from fuel conversion to formation of single wall carbon nanotubes.
	This paper provides a concise overview of plasma-chemical reactions
	(PCRs) in low pressure reactive plasmas and discusses possible experimental
	and theoretical methods for the investigation of their plasma chemistry.
	An up-to-date summary of the knowledge about low pressure acetylene
	plasmas is given and two particular examples are discussed in detail:

  pages = {267--276},
  number = {2},
  month = feb,
  abstract = {During the 1981 Voyager encounter, Titan's stratosphere exhibited
	a large thermal asymmetry, with high northern latitudes being colder
	than comparable southern latitudes. Given the short radiative time
	constant, this asymmetry would not be expected at the season of the
	Voyager observations (spring equinox), if the infrared and solar
	opacity sources were distributed symmetrically. We have investigated
	the radiative budget of Titan's stratosphere, using two selections
	of Voyager IRIS spectra recorded at symmetric northern and southern
	latitudes. In the region 0.1-1 mbar, temperatures are 7 K colder
	at 50[degree sign]N than at 53[degree sign]S and the difference reaches
	~13 K at 5 mbar. On the other hand, the northern region is strongly
	enriched in nitriles and hydrocarbons, and the haze optical depth
	derived from the continuum emission between 8 and 15 [mu]m is twice
	as large as in the south. Cooling rate profiles have been computed
	at the two locations, using the gas and haze abundances derived from
	the IRIS measurements. We find that, despite lower temperatures,
	the cooling rate profiles in the pressure range 0.15-5 mbar are 20
	to 40% larger in the north than in the south, because of the enhanced
	concentrations of infrared radiators. Because the northern hemisphere
	appears darker than the southern one in the Voyager images, enhanced
	solar heating is also expected to take place at 50[degree sign]N.
	Solar heating rate profiles have been calculated, with two different
	assumptions on the origin of the hemispheric asymmetry. In the most
	likely case where it results from a variation in the absorbance of
	the haze material, the heating rates are found to be 12-15% larger
	at the northern location than at the southern one, a smaller increase
	than that in the cooling rates. If the lower albedo in the north
	results from an increase in the particle number density, a 55 to
	75% difference is found for the pressure range 0.15-5 mbar, thus
	larger than that calculated for the cooling rates. Considering the
	uncertainties in the haze model, dynamical heat transport may significantly
	contribute to the meridional temperature gradients observed in the
	stratosphere. On the other hand, the latitudinal variation in gas
	and haze composition may be sufficient to explain the entire temperature
	asymmetry observed, without invoking a lag in the thermal response
	of the atmosphere due to dynamical inertia.},

	has the advantage of producing short-duration, high-temp. plasmas
	free from electrode contamination. The laser-induced plasma discharges
	in air accurately simulate terrestrial lightning and can be expected
	to simulate lightning spectra in other planetary atmospheres. Spectra
	from 240 to 880 nm are presented for simulated lightning in the atmospheres
	of Venus, Earth, Jupiter, and Titan. The spectra of lightning on
	the other giant planets are expected to be similar to that ot Jupiter
	because the atmospheres of these planets are composed mainly of H
	and He. The spectra of Venus and Titan show substantial amts. of
	radiation due to the presence of C atoms and ions and show CN Violet
	radiation. Although small amts. of CH4 and NH3 are present in the
	Jovian atm., only emission from H and He was obsd. Most difference
	in the spectra can be understood in terms of the elemental ratios
	of the gas mixts. Consequently, observations of the spectra of lightning
	on other planets should provide in situ ests. of the atm. and aerosol
	compn. in the cloud layers in which lightning is occurring. In particular,
	the detection of inert gases such as He should be possible and the
	relative abundance of these gases compared to major constituents
	might be detd. [on SciFinder (R)]},

	The resulting energy deposition, which takes place mainly below 1000

	the synthesis of org. compds. which have not been detected to date

  abstract = {A review with 31 refs. gives an overview of the basic characteristics
	in terms of structure and atm. of the planets and their satellites.
	This is adapted from a plenary lecture delivered at the 5th International
	Conference on Thermodn. of Solns. of Non-Electrolites in Oporto,
	Portugal in 1992. The birth of modern science is linked to the first
	systematic observations of the solar system by Galileo in the 17th
	century. His first important publication, Sidereus Nuncius (1610),
	had a tremendous impact on fellow scientists as well as on painters
	and writers. This lecture attempts to draw a parallel between those
	pioneering observations and the current spate of space missions to
	explore the solar system. Although most of the direct measurements
	are carried out through spectroscopic techniques, the modeling of
	the structure of the planets (including, when relevant, their atmospheres)
	is based on kinetics and thermodn. In the 1960's, Venus provided
	the first example of a thermodn. model applied to a planet. Among
	the most interesting bodies in the solar system are Titan (a satellite
	of Saturn) and Triton (a satellite of Neptune). Both have nitrogen
	atmospheres, but whereas Triton exhibits a frozen surface, with polar
	ice caps and geysers, the (invisible) surface of Titan should be
	extensively covered by an ocean of liq. ethane and methane. This
	is the realm of thermodn. of simple mols. at cryogenic temps. Some
	recent phase equil. and calorimetric measurements on the relevant
	systems are helping to form a coherent picture of the structure and
	atm. of these planets, in anticipation of the forthcoming (1996)
	Cassini mission. Given the overwhelming presence of the Sun, it is
	rarely possible to develop a feasible model for the atmospheres of
	the various planets on the basis of classical thermodn. alone. What
	happens is largely detd. by a tug-of-war between photochem. (driven
	by the Sun) and thermodn. (driven by the interior heat of the planets).

	and j(O1 D) under identical and well-defined experimental conditions,
	(2) to compare results of blind theoretical modeling of j(NO2) and

	(3) to compare the experimental and model results for the j values,
	(4) to compare the measured and modeled downwelling actinic flux,
	and (5) on the basis of the results, make recommendations for the
	choices between alternative quantum yield and cross-section data.
	The findings of the IPMMI experiment are described in a series of
	papers in this issue [e.g., Shetter et al., 2003; Bais et al., 2003],
	and the overall conclusions are summarized here. Actinic fluxes can

	chem. of the satellite is dominated by 2 atm. processes: photochem.
	and energetic particle bombardment. Photochem. reactions of CH4 in
	the upper atm. can account for the presence of C2 hydrocarbons. Reactions
	initiated in various levels of the atm. by cosmic ray, Saturn wind,
	and solar-wind particle bombardment of a CH4-N2 atm. mixt. can account
	for the UV-visible absorbing stratospheric haze, the reddish appearance
	of the satellite, and some of the C2 hydrocarbons. In the lower atm.,
	photochem. processes will be important if surface temps. are sufficiently
	high for gaseous NH3 and CH4; if 0.1% of the incident UV light from
	1600-2270 .ANG. reaches the lower atm., these reactions will be capable

	dissociate by loss of the imine hydrogen atom, a methyl hydrogen,
	and by CH3---CNH bond cleavage. The branching ratios for the loss
	of the imine hydrogen (H or D) and methyl group (CH3 or CD3) were
	determined for CH3CNH, CD3CNH, CH3CND, and CD3CND as 70/30, 66/34,
	43/57, and 61/39, respectively. Ab initio calculations with coupled
	clusters with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations/aug-cc-pVTZ

	transition-state energy. The calculated branching ratios that were
	based on RiceRamspergerKasselMarcus (RRKM) unimolecular rate constants
	agreed with the mass spectrometric data within experimental accuracy.

	be incompetitive (<0.1%) on the ground doublet electronic states

	in exptl. simulation thus far. All these compds. are thermally unstable,

	expts. with temp. conditions close to that of Titan's environment.
	It also uses dedicated anal. techniques and procedures compatible
	with the anal. of orgs. only stable at low temps., as well solid
	products of low stability in the presence of O2 and H2O. Spark discharge
	of N2-CH4 gas mixts. was carried out at low temp. in the range 100-150

	were identified by their mass spectrum, and, in most cases, by comparison
	of the retention time and mass spectrum with std. ones. In Titan
	simulation expts., C6H2 and HC5N were detected. Their abundance is
	a few percent relative to C4H2 and HC3N, resp. Preliminary data on

	recoil velocity distribution arising in the 121.6 nm photolysis of
	CH4 is rationalised in terms of initial excitation to both the 2(1)A'
	and 1(1)A{''} excited states (Jahn-Teller components of the degenerate
	T-1(2) state), followed by a range of decay mechanisms. CH4(2(1)A')
	molecules can decay adiabatically, via sequential extension of first
	one, then a second, C-H bond with eventual formation of two H atoms
	and CH2((a) over tilde (1)A(1)) products, or after internal conversion
	(IC) to the ground state. The H+CH3((X) over tilde) products resulting
	from the IC process display a recoil velocity distribution characterised
	by an anisotropy parameter beta similar to +2, implying that the
	fragmentation involves irreversible extension of the C-H bond along
	which the transition dipole points at the instant of photon absorption.
	Fragmentation of CH4(1(1)A{''}) molecules to H+CH3((X) over tilde)
	products proceeds via intersystem crossing to the lowest (3)A' potential
	energy surface. The recoil anisotropy of these products (beta similar
	to -0.45) implies that this radiationless process also occurs on
	a timescale that is rapid compared to the parent rotational period.
	Both single H-C bond fission channels may yield CH3((X) over tilde)
	products with such high levels of internal excitation that they are
	unstable with respect to further unimolecular decay; any H atoms
	that result from this secondary decay must contribute to the observed
	yield of slow H atoms with beta similar to0. All H atoms resulting
	from Lyman-alpha photolysis of both SiH4 and GeH4 have (low) kinetic
	energies and little or no recoil anisotropy, compatible with their
	being formed via three body fragmentation to, primarily, H+H+SiH2/GeH2((X)
	over tilde (1)A(1)) products. Faster H atoms are evident in the total
	kinetic energy release (TKER) spectra obtained following 157.6 nm
	photoexcitation of SiH4, but the power dependence of this fast H
	atom signal implies that these arise as a result of a two photon
	process involving initial formation of SiH2+H-2 products and subsequent
	photolysis of the nascent silylene fragments.}},

	from a set of radiance measurements made by the Voyager IRIS instrument
	at 300 and 510 cm-1 (33.3 and 19.6 mm). At 510 cm-1, Titan's atm.
	is relatively transparent and the surface contribution to the measured
	radiance is approx. 60%. On the other hand, the 300 cm-1 radiance
	is mostly sensitive to the tropopause temp., as well as to the degree
	of methane supersatn. in the upper troposphere. The retrievals are
	based on a simple inversion scheme of the radiative transfer equation
	and rely on a model of the atm. opacity derived by Courtin et al.
	(Icarus 114 (1995) 144). Although the longitude-latitude coverage
	afforded by the IRIS dataset is severely limited, as is also the
	surface area covered by the IRIS footprints (.apprx.22%), we were
	able to ext. longitudinal and latitudinal profiles of the tropopause
	and near-surface (brightness) temps. We find that the zonal distributions
	of the tropopause and near-surface temps. are fairly homogeneous.
	The meridional distribution of the tropopause temp. shows only a
	slight increase (.apprx.1 K) from -60 Deg to 60 Deg. On the other
	hand, the surface brightness temp. varies significantly and sym.
	from equator to pole (2.5-3.2 K). Less then one-third of this decrease
	can potentially be attributed to meridional variations of the stratospheric
	thermal structure. This confirms earlier results obtained from more
	limited selections of the IRIS data, both in terms of symmetry and
	amplitude. The role that could be played by meridional variations
	of the supersatd. distribution of methane is explored, although no
	definite answer can be derived in this respect. A significant variation
	of the bulk temp. gradient between the surface and the tropopause
	is suggested, the troposphere at high latitudes appearing more stable
	with respect to moist convection than in the equatorial regions.
	Finally, a very tentative result concerns an area where the near-surface
	(brightness) temp. shows a significant differential with respect
	to the extrapolation of the latitudinal distribution of surface temps.
	Possible interpretations of this differential include: a low emissivity
	surface feature with 25% contrast, an actual surface cold spot (with
	a temp. contrast of .apprx.3 K), a transient tropospheric cloud of
	optical thickness t.apprx.1, or an elevated area of height .apprx.5

	(a) the haze extinction profile that best matches the data is one
	with higher (by 40%) extinction in the atmosphere with respect to
	Rannou et al. (2003) down to about 30 km where a complete cut-off
	occurs; (b) the methane mixing ratio at Titan's surface cannot exceed
	3% on a disk-average basis, yielding a maximum CH4 column abundance
	of 2.27 km-am in Titan's atmosphere. From the derived surface albedo
	spectrum in the 2.7-3.08 micron region, we bring some constraints
	on Titan's surface composition. The albedo in the center of the methane
	window varies from 0.01 to 0.08. These values, compared to others
	reported in the other methane windows, show a strong compatibility
	with the water ice spectrum in the near-infrared. Without confirming
	its existence from this work alone, our data then appear to be compatible
	with water ice. A variety of other ices, such as CO2, NH3, tholin
	material or hydrocarbon liquid cannot be excluded from our data,
	but an additional unidentified component with a signature around
	2.74 micron is required to satisfy the data.},

  abstract = {[ 1] On October 26, 2004, during its first encounter with Titan (
	Ta), the Cassini Orbiter moved from the dayside to the nightside
	with a closest approach altitude of 1174 km. In situ measurements
	of the main part of Titan's ionosphere were made by the Langmuir
	probe on the Cassini Radio and Plasma Wave Experiment ( RPWS), while
	the Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer ( INMS) measured the main constituents
	of the neutral atmosphere. The results of model calculations of Titan's
	ionosphere for Ta encounter conditions ( e. g., near the terminator)
	are presented in this paper. The paper includes comparisons of calculated
	and measured electron densities along the spacecraft track. Ionization
	both by solar radiation and by incoming energetic electrons from
	Saturn's magnetosphere are needed to obtain good agreement between
	the measured and calculated electron densities.},

	We suggest that a few percent of the oxygen flux is converted to

	Both reactions are bond-selective processes in which the initial

	is possible to cleave either the CH bond or CD bond in the reaction
	of Cl with CH3D, CH2D2, or CHD3 and, similarly, to use initial excitation
	of the CH stretch to promote dissociation of CHD3 to CD3 and H on
	a Ni surface. Different vibrational modes, such as the symmetric
	and antisymmetric stretches in CH3D or CH4, lead to very different
	reactivities, and molecules with the symmetric stretching vibration
	excited can be as much as 10 times more reactive than ones with the

	various neutral species in Titan's upper atmosphere, between 950
	and 1,500 km for abundant species (N2, CH4, H2) and between 950 and
	1,200 km for other minor species. Our analysis is based on a large
	sample of Cassini/INMS (Ion Neutral Mass Spectrometer) measurements
	in the CSN (Closed Source Neutral) mode, obtained during 15 close
	flybys of Titan. To untangle the overlapping cracking patterns, we
	adopt Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to determine simultaneously
	the densities of different species. Except for N2, CH4, H2 and 40Ar
	(as well as their isotopes), all species present density enhancements
	measured during the outbound legs. This can be interpreted as a result
	of wall effects, which could be either adsorption/desorption of these
	molecules or heterogeneous surface chemistry of the associated radicals
	on the chamber walls. In this paper, we provide both direct inbound
	measurements assuming ram pressure enhancement only and abundances
	corrected for wall adsorption/desorption based on a simple model
	to reproduce the observed time behavior. Among all minor species
	of photochemical interest, we have firm detections of C2H2, C2H4,
	C2H6, CH3C2H, C4H2, C6H6, CH3CN, HC3N, C2N2 and NH3 in Titan's upper
	atmosphere. Upper limits are given for other minor species. The globally
	averaged distributions of N2, CH4 and H2 are each modeled with the
	diffusion approximation. The N2 profile suggests an average thermospheric
	temperature of 151 K. The CH4 and H2 profiles constrain their fluxes
	to be and , referred to Titan's surface. Both fluxes are significantly
	higher than the Jeans escape values. The INMS data also suggest horizontal/diurnal
	variations of temperature and neutral gas distribution in Titan's
	thermosphere. The equatorial region, the ramside, as well as the
	nightside hemisphere of Titan appear to be warmer and present some
	evidence for the depletion of light species such as CH4. Meridional
	variations of some heavy species are also observed, with a trend
	of depletion toward the north pole. Though some of the above variations
	might be interpreted by either the solar-driven models or auroral-driven
	models, a physical scenario that reconciles all the observed horizontal/diurnal
	variations in a consistent way is still missing. With a careful evaluation
	of the effect of restricted sampling, some of the features shown
	in the INMS data are more likely to be observational biases.},

  abstract = {Much emphasis has been devoted recently to the experimental determination
	of absolute electron-impact ionization cross sections of molecules
	and radicals because of the importance of these cross sections in
	many applications (e.g. as input parameters to modeling codes for
	various purposes). Supporting theoretical calculations have been
	lagging behind to some extent. Because of the inherent complexity
	of such calculations, simplistic additivity rules and semiempirical
	methods have often been used in place of more rigorous calculation
	schemes, particularly in applications where a larger number of cross
	section data were needed with reasonable precision. Although these
	methods have often proved to be quite successful as descriptive tools
	(i.e. reproducing existing experimental ionization cross sections
	reasonably well), their ability to calculate cross sections for species
	for which no experimental data are available (predictive capabilities)
	tend to be limited or questionable. This topical review describes
	recent progress in the development of more rigorous approaches for
	the calculation of absolute electron-impact molecular ionization
	cross sections. The main emphasis will be on the application of the
	semiclassical Deutsch-Mark (DM) formalism, which was originally developed
	for the calculation of atomic ionization cross sections, to molecular
	targets, and on the binary-encounter-Bethe (BEB) method of Kim and
	Rudd. The latter is a simpler version of the more rigorous binary-encounter-dipole
	(BED) theory, which was also first developed for the calculation
	of atomic ionization cross sections, and based on the methods developed
	by Khare and co-workers. Extensive comparisons between available
	experimental cross sections and the predictions of these theoretical
	models will be made for 31 molecules and free radicals (H2, N2, O2,

  abstract = {Titan, the sixth Saturnine moon, is a unique celestial body in many
	respects, including the existence of a high-d. atm. over a relatively
	small astrophys. object, chem. activity in the low-potential reducing
	medium, the presence of an extensive aerosol domain, etc. Despite
	many observations, simulation expts. and theor. models, the general
	picture of Titan's atm. photochem. is still imprecise. This study
	of the most general features of chem. activity in Titan's atm. by
	means of Generalized Kinetic Anal. (GKA) is based on the point that
	both the probability and efficiency of kinetic trends are estd. solely
	on the basis of energy/material restrictions and general kinetic
	laws. Only the quantity (intensity) and quality (spectrum) of the
	external driving force are considered closely, while both the particular
	kinetic demands and low internal energy resources of Titan's background
	are discounted. What this means is that the main inferences of GKA
	should be valid for any given kinetic model. Only a small part Lch
	of the total external energy flux Labs.apprx.12.6 W m-2 is photochem.
	active Lch = (L1ion + L2ion + L1dis) + L2ch = (1.5 * 10-3 + 0.22
	* 10-3 + 10.6 * 10-3) + 0.69 W m-2. The secondary energy L2ch (1440<l<3500.ANG.)
	meets the common energy requirements, while the primary energies
	L1ion, L2ion and L1dis define kinetic pathways of the chem. process,
	i.e. L1ion (790<l<980.ANG.) and L2ion (l<790.ANG.) initiate ionic
	photochem. via ionization of CH4 and N2, resp., while L1dis (980<l<1440.ANG.)
	provides photodissocn. of CH4 to neutral species. Because of severe
	energy/material restrictions, the general chem. process proceeds
	in the form of a self-sustaining Diels-Alder diene low-temp. synthesis
	to give telomerization and polymn. GKA proves that the main kinetic
	pathways (photodissocn. to neutrals and charged photoionization)
	play different roles with respect to the quant. and qual. formation
	of the final stable products of Titan's atm. photochem. The neutral

	reactions for 22 hydrocarbon species along with at. and mol. hydrogen.
	The method of conservation of second-order moments is used for the
	meridional and vertical advection calcns. Coustenis and Bezard (1995)
	analyzed the Voyager IRIS data to calc. hydrocarbon abundances from
	53 DegS to 70 DegN. They detd. that the ethane mixing ratio was approx.
	const. for all sampled latitudes. In the absence of meridional transport,
	photochem. would yield higher concns. of C2 and C3 hydrocarbon species
	near the equator than near the poles. Meridional advection results
	in enough tracer transport from low to high latitudes that the latitudinal
	distributions for ethane are much more uniform. The model shows methane
	is well mixed in Titan's stratosphere. Model mixing ratios for ethane
	and propane agree well with Voyager IRIS data; however, the model
	overestimates the abundances of acetylene and diacetylene. The model
	abundance for methylacetylene is within the Voyager observational
	uncertainty, but the abundance for mid-southern latitudes is at the
	high end of this uncertainty. The model does not accurately reproduce
	the obsd. ethylene abundances. Mid-latitude column densities (above
	5 mbar) for ethane, propane, acetylene, and methylacetylene vary

	1 measurements of E. Lellouch et al. (1989), are used to constrain
	several properties of Titan's ocean. Thermodn. equil. is assumed
	between atm. and ocean. The ocean is considered as a nonideal soln.
	Depending on atm. parameters, the main ocean features can vary drastically.
	Assuming a 92.5K surface temp., a 1.5-atm surface pressure, and an
	Ar-free atm., a 1.55% CH4 mole fraction in the low troposphere implies
	an ocean composed of >90% C2H8 (and heavier alkanes), .apprx.7.3%
	CH4, and 1.8% N. At 101K for the same surface pressure with an atm.
	contg. 17% Ar and 21.1% CH4, the ocean is composed of 5% C2H6 and
	higher alkanes, 83.4% CH4, 6% N, and 5.6% Ar. Other components are
	quant. negligible. The solubilities and thickness of ppt. for several
	minor oceanic components are derived and presented. Thickness of

  abstract = {High-resolution spectroscopy in the millimeter and submillimeter range
	has made significant contributions to the study of chemical composition
	and thermal structure of planetary and satellite atmospheres. This
	field of research is expected to make considerable progress in the
	future, from both ground-based and space experiments, with the availability
	of heterodyne receivers at frequencies up to 1 THz, and with the
	development of space missions devoted to the exploration of the far-infrared
	and submillimeter range. A compilation of guidelines for searching
	molecular species in planetary atmospheres through their rotational
	transitions, from the millimeter to the far-infrared range (100 [mu]m)
	is presented. These transitions are specified, and the corresponding
	synthetic spectra are shown, or detectability limits are estimated.
	Several observational scenarios are considered: (1) ground-based
	heterodyne observations (such as those with IRAM, CSO, JCMT); (2)
	space heterodyne observations with a 3 m antenna (such as that on
	the European FIRST space mission); (3) Fabry-Perot spectroscopic
	observations from the ground and from space (such as the ISO and
	FIRST space missions). All planets (except Mercury) and the three
	satellites surrounded by an atmosphere, Titan, Triton and Io, are
	considered. The main results of this compilation can be summarized
	as follows. In addition to previously detected molecules, several
	species appear as promising candidates for detection in the far-infrared
	to millimeter spectral range. For ground-based heterodyne observations,
	they include: HCl, O3 and SO on Venus; HCl, O3, H2O2 and NO on Mars;
	HCl in the giant planets; SO on Io. For space observations, they
	are: O2 on Venus and Mars (provided Venus is observable with FIRST),
	H2O in Saturn and Titan (with ISO and FIRST); HD, HCl and other halides
	in the giant planets (ISO). In the case of heterodyne observations,

	the Fabry-Perot modes (R = 8000-30,000) of the two instruments were
	used. The main results are (1) the detection of water vapor in the
	deep troposphere of Saturn; (2) the detection of new hydrocarbons
	(CH3C2H, C4H2, C6H6, CH3) in Saturn's stratosphere; (3) the detection
	of water vapor and CO2 in the stratospheres of Jupiter and Saturn;
	(4) a new detn. of the D/H ratio from the detection of HD rotational
	lines. The origin of the external oxygen source on Jupiter and Saturn
	(also found in the other giant planets and Titan in comparable amts.)
	may be either interplanetary (micrometeoritic flux) or local (rings

	does not always produce the most accurate docked pose when compared

	the most accurate docking pose. The docking scores are also highly
	sensitive to the source of the input conformation, which might introduce
	some noise in compound ranking and in binding affinity predictions.
	It is concluded that for the purposes of reproducibility and optimal

	structures for docking. The implications of these results on docking

  abstract = {Photolysis of NH3 at 185 nm in the presence of a two-fold excess of
	CH4 results in the loss of about 0.25 mole of CH4 per mole of NH3
	decomposed (delta CH4/delta NH3). The loss arises from the abstraction
	of hydrogen atoms from CH4 by photolytically generated hot hydrogen
	atoms, the presence of which is established by the constancy of delta
	CH4/delta NH3 between 298 and 156 K and by the quenching of the abstraction
	reaction when either H2 or SF6 is added. From the latter result,
	it can be concluded that NH3 photolysis in the H2-abundant atmosphere
	of Jupiter is not responsible for the presence of the carbon compounds
	observed there such as ethane, acetylene, and hydrogen cyanide, but
	may have had a role in the early atmosphere of Titan. Photolysis
	of PH3 with a 206 nm light source gives P2H4, which in turn is converted
	to a red-brown solid (P4?). The course of the photolysis is not changed
	appreciably when the temperatures is lowered to 157 K except that
	the concentration of P2H4 increases. The presence of H2 has no effect
	on the P2H4 yield. Photolysis of 9:1 NH3:PH3 gives a rate of decomposition
	of PH3 that is comparable with that observed by the direct photolysis
	of PH3. Comparable amounts of P2H4 and the red-brown solid are also
	observed. The mechanisms of these photochemical reactions together
	with their implications to the atmospheric chemistry of Jupiter are
	discussed. The structures of the compounds responsible for the wide
	array of colors e.g., brown, red and white, observed in the atmosphere
	of Jupiter have been the subject of extensive speculation. One theory
	suggests that these colors are due to organic materials formed by
	the action of either solar ultraviolet light or electric discharges
	on mixtures of CH4, NH3 and NH4HS in the Jovian atmosphere (Ponnamperuma,
	1976; Khare et al., 1978). An alternative hypothesis is that the
	colors are due to inorganic compounds resulting from the photolysis
	of NH4HS and PH3 (Lewis and Prinn, 1970; Prinn and Lewis, 1975).
	In this paper we will summarize our experiments which were designed
	to test some of these hypotheses. [on SciFinder (R)]},

  abstract = {Abstract: Using a crossed laser-molecular beam scattering apparatus,
	these experiments photodissociate ethyl chloride at 193 nm and detect
	the Cl and ethyl products, resolved by their center-of-mass recoil
	velocities, with vacuum ultraviolet photoionization. The data determine
	the relative partial cross-sections for the photoionization of ethyl
	radicals to form C2H5+, C2H4+, and C2H3+ at 12.1 and 13.8 eV. The
	data also determine the internal energy distribution of the ethyl
	radical prior to photoionization, so we can assess the internal energy
	dependence of the photoionization cross-sections. The results show
	that the C2H4+ + H and C2H3+ + H2 dissociative photoionization cross-sections
	strongly depend on the photoionization energy. Calibrating the ethyl
	radical partial photoionization cross-sections relative to the bandwidth-averaged
	photoionization cross-section of Cl atoms near 13.8 eV allows us
	to use these data in conjunction with literature estimates of the
	Cl atom photoionization cross-sections to put the present bandwidth-averaged
	cross-sections on an absolute scale. The resulting bandwidth-averaged
	cross-section for the photoionization of ethyl radicals to C2H5+
	near 13.8 eV is 8 ± 2 Mb. Comparison of our 12.1 eV data with high-resolution
	ethyl radical photoionization spectra allows us to roughly put the
	high-resolution spectrum on the same absolute scale. Thus, one obtains
	the photoionization cross-section of ethyl radicals to C2H5+ from
	threshold to 12.1 eV. The data show that the onset of the C2H4+ +
	H dissociative photoionization channel is above 12.1 eV; this result
	offers a simple way to determine whether the signal observed in photoionization
	experiments on complex mixtures is due to ethyl radicals. We discuss
	an application of the results for resolving the product branching

	issues concerning Titan's atm. is the methane cycle. Although the
	broad outline of the breakup of methane by photolytic and catalytic
	dissocn. to produce a suite of more complex hydrocarbons and nitriles
	(addnl. requiring the dissocn. of N2) is understood, several fundamental
	questions exist, and many details remain obscure. The spatial distribution
	of stratospheric hydrocarbons and nitriles was inferred from Voyager
	thermal IR spectra, but only at northern spring equinox. The photochem.,
	radiative, and dynamical processes underlying this distribution are
	not well understood. Addnl., methane itself is important both radiatively
	and (possibly) dynamically in the troposphere. Voyager IR and radio-occultation
	measurements place some constraints on the vertical and horizontal
	distribution of methane, and suggest that it may be supersatd. in
	the upper troposphere. The presence of convective activity assocd.
	with methane condensation is unknown, but recent work indicates that
	a meager amt. of convection (compared to Earth) could be sufficient
	to transport heat and methane vertically and account in part for
	the vertical thermal structure of Titan's troposphere and provide
	a major source of methane for the stratosphere. The addnl. measurements
	provided by Cassini over a four-year period will greatly improve
	the understanding of these issues. Emphasis in this paper is on the
	combination of radio occultation measurements and thermal IR spectra,

	al.. Because of the significant rearrangement of bonds that must
	take place, the branching ratio for the latter channel has been assumed
	to be negligible, and DR of CO+2 has been assumed to produce mainly
	CO + O. In order to test the effect of including the branching ratio
	of CO+2 DR that produces C + O2 on the ambient densities of thermal
	and escaping C in planetary thermospheres,we have we have constructed
	revised models of the thermospheres/ionospheres of Mars and Venus.
	Because of space limitations, we discuss here only the high solar
	activity models. For Mars, we find that DR of CO+2 is the most important
	source of thermal C, but that the production rate of escaping C is
	not increased. There are important differences between the thermospheres
	of Venus and Mars, and we find that the inclusion of the C + O2 channel
	in the Venus models increases the production rate of atomic carbon
	in the Venus thermosphere by only 10-16%. At high altitudes on Venus,
	C+ is mostly produced by photoionization and electron-impact ionization
	of C, with some contribution from the charge transfer reaction, O+
	+ C - C+ + O. We compare our computed C density altitude profiles
	to those inferred by Paxton from Pioneer Venus Orbiter Ultraviolet
	Spectrometer limb scans of the atomic carbon emission features at
	1561 and 1657 A. Since the most important loss process for C is reaction
	with O2, this allows us to to constrain the abundance of O2 in the
	Venus thermosphere. We then compute density profiles of C+ and compare
	them to those measured by the Pioneer Venus Orbiter Ion Mass Spectrometer
	(OIMS) (e.g., Taylor et al. [3]) to determine the rate coefficient
	for the charge transfer reaction of O+ to C.},

  abstract = {Abstract&nbsp;&nbsp;We discuss here the energy deposition of solar
	FUV, EUV and X-ray photons, energetic auroral particles, and pickup
	ions. Photons and the photoelectrons that they produce may interact
	with thermospheric neutral species producing dissociation, ionization,
	excitation, and heating. The interaction of X-rays or keV electrons
	with atmospheric neutrals may produce core-ionized species, which
	may decay by the production of characteristic X-rays or Auger electrons.
	Energetic particles may precipitate into the atmosphere, and their
	collisions with atmospheric particles also produce ionization, excitation,
	and heating, and auroral emissions. Auroral energetic particles,
	like photoelectrons, interact with the atmospheric species through
	discrete collisions that produce ionization, excitation, and heating
	of the ambient electron population. Auroral particles are, however,
	not restricted to the sunlit regions. They originate outside the
	atmosphere and are more energetic than photoelectrons, especially
	at magnetized planets. The spectroscopic analysis of auroral emissions
	is discussed here, along with its relevance to precipitating particle
	diagnostics. Atmospheres can also be modified by the energy deposited
	by the incident pickup ions with energies of eVâs to MeVâs; these
	particles may be of solar wind origin, or from a magnetospheric plasma.
	When the modeling of the energy deposition of the plasma is calculated,
	the subsequent modeling of the atmospheric processes, such as chemistry,
	emission, and the fate of hot recoil particles produced is roughly
	independent of the exciting radiation. However, calculating the spatial
	distribution of the energy deposition versus depth into the atmosphere
	produced by an incident plasma is much more complex than is the calculation
	of the solar excitation profile. Here, the nature of the energy deposition
	processes by the incident plasma are described as is the fate of
	the hot recoil particles produced by exothermic chemistry and by
	knock-on collisions by the incident ions.},

	three different approaches to the Cassini data set. Our findings
	are threefold: (1) The effective recombination coefficient derived
	under sunlit conditions in the deep ionosphere (&lt;1200 km) is found
	to be independent of solar zenith angle and flyby. Its value ranges
	from 6.9 × 10&#8722;7 cm3 s&#8722;1 at 1200 km to 5.9 × 10&#8722;6
	cm3 s&#8722;1 at 970 km at 500 K. (2) The presence of an additional,
	minor source of ionization is revealed when the solar contribution
	is weak enough. The contribution by this non-solar source&#8212;energetic
	electrons most probably of magnetospheric origin&#8212;becomes apparent
	for secondary electron production rates, due to solar illumination
	alone, close to or smaller than about 3 × 10&#8722;1 cm&#8722;3 s&#8722;1.
	Such a threshold is reached near the solar terminator below the main
	solar-driven electron production peak (&lt;1050 km). (3) Our ability

	Our findings highlight the need for more laboratory measurements
	of electron dissociative recombination coefficients for heavy ion

  abstract = {Abstract: The reactions of singlet methylene (a1A1 1CH2) with hydrogen
	and deuterium have been studied by experimental and theoretical techniques.
	The rate coefficients for the removal of singlet methylene with H2
	(k1) and D2 (k2) have been measured from 195 to 798 K and are essentially
	temperature-independent with values of k1 = (10.48 0.32) × 1011
	cm3 molecule1 s1 and k2 = (5.98 0.34) × 1011 cm3 molecule1 s1,
	where the errors represent 2Ã, giving a ratio of k1/k2 = 1.75 0.11.
	In the reaction with H2, singlet methylene can be removed by reaction
	giving CH3 + H or deactivated to ground-state triplet methylene.
	Direct measurement of the H atom product showed that the fraction
	of relaxation decreased from 0.3 at 195 K to essentially zero at
	398 K. For the reaction with deuterium, either H or D may be eliminated.
	Experimentally, the H:D ratio was determined to be 1.8 0.5 over the
	range 195398 K. Theoretically, the reaction kinetics has been predicted
	with variable reaction coordinate transition state theory and with
	rigid-body trajectory simulations employing various high-level, ab
	initio-determined potential energy surfaces. The magnitudes of the
	calculated rate coefficients are in agreement with experiment, but
	the calculations show a significant negative temperature dependence
	that is not observed in the experimental results. The calculated
	and experimental H to D ratios from the reaction of singlet methylene
	with D2 are in good agreement, suggesting that the reaction proceeds
	entirely through the formation of a long-lived methane intermediate
	with a statistical distribution of energy.},

	300 K has been calculated as k=4.16x10-10 cm3[middle dot]mol-1[middle
	dot]s-1. The reaction barrier is 109.847 kJ[middle dot]mol-1 at 298.15
	K, which is probably too high to allow this reaction to occur in
	the atmosphere of Titan. The kinetic properties of the reaction are
	calculated at a pressure of 90 Pa and a temperature ranging from
	1 to 5000 K. It is found that this reaction has a very low reaction
	rate under low temperature in Titan's atmosphere and that the rate
	decreases drastically with decreasing temperature. This result should
	be applicable to interstellar place with low temperature values.
	The results are compared with those obtained from experiments.},

  abstract = {Alcohols and nitriles not only play an important role as templates
	for synthesis of larger molecules in the interstellar medium and

	for biomolecules. Alcohols can form carbohydrates through reaction
	with HCO and nitriles can be hydrolysed to amino acids in aqueous
	solutions, which is the final step of the well-known Strecker synthesis.
	Therefore the question of the pathways of formation of alcohols and
	nitriles and the efficiency and the product distribution of their
	subsequent degradation reactions in the above-mentioned astrophysical
	environments is of great interest. In both processes dissociative
	recombination reactions of protonated nitriles and alcohols may play
	a major role and are included in models of interstellar clouds and
	planetary atmospheres. However, the reaction rate coefficients and
	product branching ratios for the majority of these processes are
	so far still unknown, which adversely affects the quality of predictions

	Detection of argon would indicate that the N2 and CO now found in
	the atm. probably came in with ice during Titan's accretion. If there
	is very little argon, then we have to turn to models starting with
	frozen ammonia, methane and water ice, indicating a more important
	role for the Saturn sub-nebula, and requiring subsequent modification
	by photochem. Current ests. on the fraction of argon in Titan's atm.
	are based on indirect evidence and range from 0 to 25%. We have modeled
	Titan's atm. with argon as an added constituent. Using a photoelectron
	transport code, we detd. the photoelectron flux in a std. model Titan
	atm. with energy degrdn. and transport of photoelectrons due solely
	to N2. The calcd. photoelectron flux was then used to excite the
	N2, Ar, and CH4 in the upper atm. of Titan using appropriate electron
	impact EUV emission cross sections. Photodissociative excitation
	of N2, resulting in emissions by N and N+ fragments, were also included.
	The resulting emission profiles were used to simulate the expected
	brightnesses of several features in the EUV dayglow spectrum of Titan.
	In particular, the bright resonance line of argon at 1048 .ANG. is
	predicted to be present at a level of 5-10 R, depending on the assumed
	abundance of argon in the lower atm. of Titan. We then consider observability
	of the argon dayglow emission by the Berkeley spectrometer to be
	flown as part of the German/US Shuttle-borne ORFEUS mission. This
	spectrometer employs four novel spherically figured varied line-space
	gratings which will provide high resoln. (l/Dl > 6000) spectra from
	390 to 1200 .ANG.. The calcd. integration time required for detection
	of argon in the atm. of Titan is about 20 h, which is, unfortunately,
	too long to be attempted during the 5-day ORFEUS mission. An accurate

	the current atmospheres of Mars and Titan, CO2 and hydrocarbons,
	resp., may condense to form clouds. In this paper, we explore cloud
	formation processes in these two very different planetary atmospheres.
	Under early Martian conditions, IR scattering by CO2 clouds could
	have warmed the planet's surface above freezing. However, the radiative
	effect of the clouds depends strongly on the nucleation and growth

	to a contact parameter of m = 0.95. After nucleation, growth of CO2
	proceeds rapidly without a surface kinetic barrier. Using a microphys.

	depth of penetration of energetic photons, affected by methane abundance.
	Radar and IR observations of bright surface regions have been explained
	by rain washing of highlands. As for the thermal profile, it is sensitive
	to CH4-N2 gas opacity, cloud opacity and could be influenced by latent
	heat exchange. A rudimentary model with no methane supersatn. and
	gas transport by eddy diffusion indicates a methane latent heat release
	of 0.2 W m-2 between 20 and 30 km altitude for a surface mole fraction
	of 4.4% and an eddy diffusion coeff. of 0.2 m2s-1. Description of
	nucleation seems to be one of the first improvements which should

	methane nucleation comes from anal. of Voyager IRIS spectra. Moreover,
	species are expected to condense to the solid phase, which excludes
	very efficient nucleation and condensation processes assocd. with
	the presence of a liq. phase, such as deliquescence. The classical
	theory of heterogeneous nucleation, despite its deficiencies, is
	employed in atm. models, owing to its general nature and relative
	simplicity. Yet, it requires phys. quantities for which exptl. values

	contact angles may be linked to other material properties which are
	within reach of lab. expts., mainly UV absorption spectra of solid
	phases. It is found that a value of 10-9-10-7s-1 for the \"crit.
	nucleation rate\" (per nucleus) is adapted to the case of Titan,
	though we question the ability of the crit. rate concept to make
	predictions for the condensation altitudes. A possible consequence
	of difficult methane nucleation is periodic evolution of the lower

  abstract = {Quantitative computational models play an increasingly important role
	in modern biology. Such models typically involve many free parameters,
	and assigning their values is often a substantial obstacle to model
	development. Directly measuring in vivo biochemical parameters is
	difficult, and collectively fitting them to other experimental data
	often yields large parameter uncertainties. Nevertheless, in earlier
	work we showed in a growth-factor-signaling model that collective
	fitting could yield well-constrained predictions, even when it left
	individual parameters very poorly constrained. We also showed that
	the model had a âsloppyâ spectrum of parameter sensitivities,
	with eigenvalues roughly evenly distributed over many decades. Here
	we use a collection of models from the literature to test whether
	such sloppy spectra are common in systems biology. Strikingly, we
	find that every model we examine has a sloppy spectrum of sensitivities.
	We also test several consequences of this sloppiness for building
	predictive models. In particular, sloppiness suggests that collective
	fits to even large amounts of ideal time-series data will often leave
	many parameters poorly constrained. Tests over our model collection
	are consistent with this suggestion. This difficulty with collective
	fits may seem to argue for direct parameter measurements, but sloppiness
	also implies that such measurements must be formidably precise and
	complete to usefully constrain many model predictions. We confirm
	this implication in our growth-factor-signaling model. Our results
	suggest that sloppy sensitivity spectra are universal in systems
	biology models. The prevalence of sloppiness highlights the power
	of collective fits and suggests that modelers should focus on predictions
	rather than on parameters.},

  abstract = {Experimental kineticists are always faced with the problem of reducing
	kinetic data to extract physically meaningful information. A particularly
	vexing problem arises when different models reproduce the data but
	yield different values for the physical parameters. For over forty-five
	years Monte Carlo simulation techniques have been used to study the
	statistical behavior of parameters extracted from data. Not only
	do these simulations provide realistic uncertainties, correlation
	coefficients, and confidence envelopes, but they also provide insight
	into the nature of the model. These insights may be obtained by viewing
	two-dimensional scatter plots of the fractional changes of the parameters
	and one-dimensional histograms of the distributions of the changes
	in the parameters. Monte Carlo simulations are illustrated with examples
	from OH+CH4 ? CH3+H2O and the high-pressure rate coefficient for
	methyl-methyl association. A more complex problem involves models
	for pressure-dependent rate coefficients in the falloff region. We
	have modeled methyl-methyl association with five of the most current
	analytic approximations for behavior in the falloff region. All of
	these reproduce the data to within their uncertainties. However,
	when Monte Carlo techniques are applied the correlations between
	the parameters and the nonlinear nature of their behavior become
	evident. We postulate that the statistical behavior of the parameters
	of a model may be used to distinguish one model from another and,
	thereby, identify those analytic approximations that hold promise
	for further investigation and utilization. Finally, the recent advent
	of high-speed workstations implies that Monte Carlo simulations should
	become a routine part of the analysis of kinetic data. © 1997 John

  abstract = {Abstract: The temperature- and pressure-dependent behavior of the
	cross section for optical absorption by the methyl radical is carefully
	considered, so we may define a criterion for selecting and correcting
	measurements of the rate coefficient for the recombination of methyl
	radicals, CH3 + CH3 C2H6. The low-temperature data of Slagle et al.,
	Hippler et al., and Walter et al. and the high-temperature data of
	Glänzer et al., Hwang et al., and our latest results (previous paper
	in this issue) are used to define a data set which contains 217 points.
	Subsets of isothermal data show that the temperature dependence of
	the high-pressure rate coefficient may be described by the simple
	exponential function A exp{-T(K)/T}. Four different formulations
	for the pressure-dependent behavior in the falloff region are used
	for the global fits: (1) the asymmetric Lorentzian broadening function
	of Gilbert et al.; (2) the Gaussian broadening function of Wang and
	Frenklach; (3) the empirical "a equation" introduced by Gardiner;
	(4) the extension of Lindemann's expression suggested by Oref. All
	formulations reproduce the data, but Oref's "J equation" produces
	the least correlation between the best-fit parameters, the least
	uncertainty in these parameters, and the smallest uncertainty in
	the predictions. These results are k(T) = 8.78 × 10-11 exp{-T(K)/723}
	cm3 s-1, k0(T) = 9.04 × 10-27 cm6 s-1, and Jexp(T) = {exp[T(K)/268]

	data in the southern hemisphere of Saturn. High resolution, 0.5 cm-1,
	CIRS data was used from three data sets taken in June-November 2004
	and binned into 2° wide latitudinal strips to increase the signal-to-noise
	ratio. Tropospheric and stratospheric temperatures were initially
	retrieved to determine the temperature profile for each latitude
	bin. The stratospheric temperature at 2 mbar increased by 14 K from
	9° to 68° S, including a steep 4 K rise between 60° and 68° S. The
	tropospheric temperatures showed significantly more meridional variation
	than the stratospheric ones, the locations of which are strongly
	correlated to that of the zonal jets. Stratospheric acetylene abundance
	decreases steadily from 30 to 68° S, by a factor of 1.8 at 2.0 mbar.
	Between 18° and 30° S the acetylene abundance increases at 2.0 mbar.
	Global values for acetylene have been calculated as (1.9±0.19)×10-7
	at 2.0 mbar, (2.6±0.27)×10-7 at 1.6 mbar and (3.1±0.32)×10-7 at 1.4

	(1.6±0.25)×10-5 at 0.5 mbar and (1.4±0.19)×10-5 at 1.0 mbar. Ethane
	abundance in the stratosphere increases towards the south pole by
	a factor of 2.5 at 2.0 mbar. The increase in stratospheric ethane
	is especially pronounced polewards of 60° S at 2.0 mbar. The increase
	of stratospheric ethane towards the south pole supports the presence
	of a meridional wind system in the stratosphere of Saturn.},

	mission revealed organic aerosol formation in the upper atmosphere
	of Titan. It is not clear, however, how much and by what mechanism
	nitrogen is incorporated in TitanÃ¢â¬â¢s organic aerosols. Using
	tunable synchrotron radiation at the Advanced Light Source, we demonstrate
	the first evidence of nitrogenated organic aerosol production by
	extreme ultravioletÃ¢â¬âvacuum ultraviolet irradiation of a N2/CH4
	gas mixture. The ultrahigh-mass-resolution study with laser desorption
	ionization-Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry
	of N2/CH4 photolytic solid products at 60 and 82.5ÃÂ nm indicates
	the predominance of highly nitrogenated compounds. The distinct nitrogen
	incorporations at the elemental abundances of H2C2N and HCN, respectively,
	are suggestive of important roles of H2C2N/HCCN and HCN/CN in their
	formation. The efficient formation of unsaturated hydrocarbons is
	observed in the gas phase without abundant nitrogenated neutrals
	at 60ÃÂ nm, and this is confirmed by separately using 13C and 15N
	isotopically labeled initial gas mixtures. These observations strongly
	suggest a heterogeneous incorporation mechanism via short lived nitrogenated
	reactive species, such as HCCN radical, for nitrogenated organic
	aerosol formation, and imply that substantial amounts of nitrogen
	is fixed as organic macromolecular aerosols in TitanÃ¢â¬â¢s atmosphere.},

	These conditions are fairly common in geology, economics and biology.
	The result is, therefore, a vector of such observations per specimen.
	The usual multivariate procedures are seldom adequate for the analysis
	of compositional data and there is a relative dearth of alternative
	techniques suitable for the same. The presence of covariates further
	adds to complexity of the situation. In this manuscript, a complete
	Bayesian methodology to model such data is developed and is illustrated
	on a real data set comprising sand, silt and clay compositions taken
	at various water depths in an Arctic lake. Alternative methods such
	as maximum likelihood estimates are compared with the proposed Bayesian
	estimates. Simulation based approach is adopted to ascertain adequacy
	of the fit. Several models are finally compared via a posterior predictive
	loss measure. Copyright © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

	reference data sets for the parametrization of more approximate methods
	(such as DFT functionals). The data were obtained by means of the
	W4 ab initio computational thermochemistry protocol, which has a
	95% confidence interval well below 1 kJ/mol. Our data sets include
	W4-08, which are total atomization energies of over 100 small molecules
	that cover varying degrees of nondynamical correlations, and DBH24-W4,
	which are W4 theory values for Truhlarâs set of 24 representative
	barrier heights. The usual procedure of comparing calculated DFT
	values with experimental atomization energies is hampered by comparatively
	large experimental uncertainties in many experimental values and
	compounds errors due to deficiencies in the DFT functional with those
	resulting from neglect of relativity and finite nuclear mass. Comparison
	with accurate, explicitly nonrelativistic, ab initio data avoids
	these issues. We then proceed to explore the performance of B2x-PLYP-type
	double hybrid functionals for atomization energies and barrier heights.
	We find that the optimum hybrids for hydrogen-transfer reactions,
	heavy-atoms transfers, nucleophilic substitutions, and unimolecular
	and recombination reactions are quite different from one another:
	out of these subsets, the heavy-atom transfer reactions are by far
	the most sensitive to the percentages of HartreeâFock-type exchange
	y and MP2-type correlation x in an (x,ây) double hybrid. The (42,72)
	hybrid B2K-PLYP, as reported in a preliminary communication, represents
	the best compromise between thermochemistry and hydrogen-transfer
	barriers, while also yielding excellent performance for nucleophilic
	substitutions. By optimizing for best overall performance on both
	thermochemistry and the DBH24-W4 data set, however, we find a new
	(36,65) hybrid which we term B2GP-PLYP. At a slight expense in performance
	for hydrogen-transfer barrier heights and nucleophilic substitutions,
	we obtain substantially better performance for the other reaction
	types. Although both B2K-PLYP and B2GP-PLYP are capable of 2 kcal/mol
	quality thermochemistry, B2GP-PLYP appears to be the more robust
	toward nondynamical correlation and strongly polar character. We
	additionally find that double-hybrid functionals display excellent
	performance for such problems as hydrogen bonding, prototype late
	transition metal reactions, pericyclic reactions, prototype cumuleneâpolyacetylene
	system, and weak interactions.},

	such as polycyclic arom. hydrocarbons and org. materials such as
	methanol and related light hydrocarbons, embedded in a dark, refractory,

	the outer gaseous planets display such component materials. One example,
	Saturn's largest satellite, Titan, whose atm. is comprised of around
	90% mol. nitrogen N2 and less than 10% methane CH4, displays this
	kind of low reflectivity material in its atm. haze. These materials
	were first recorded during the Voyager 1 and 2 flybys of Titan and
	showed up as an optically thick pinkish orange haze layer. These

  abstract = {We have investigated the abundances of Titan's stratospheric oxygen
	compounds using 0.5 cm-1 resolution spectra from the Composite Infrared
	Spectrometer on the Cassini orbiter. The CO abundance was derived
	for several observations of far-infrared nadir spectra, taken at
	a range of latitudes (75[degree sign] S-35[degree sign] N) and emission
	angles (0[degree sign]-60[degree sign]), using rotational lines that
	have not been analysed before the arrival of Cassini at Saturn. The
	derived volume mixing ratios for the different observations are mutually
	consistent regardless of latitude. The weighted mean CO volume mixing
	ratio is 47+/-8 ppm if CO is assumed to be uniform with latitude.
	H2O could not be detected and an upper limit of 0.9 ppb was determined.
	CO2 abundances derived from mid-infrared nadir spectra show no significant
	latitudinal variations, with typical values of 16+/-2 ppb. Mid-infrared
	limb spectra at 55[degree sign] S were used to constrain the vertical
	profile of CO2 for the first time. A vertical CO2 profile that is
	constant above the condensation level at a volume mixing ratio of
	15 ppb reproduces the limb spectra very well below 200 km. This is
	consistent with the long chemical lifetime of CO2 in Titan's stratosphere.
	Above 200 km the CO2 volume mixing ratio is not well constrained
	and an increase with altitude cannot be ruled out there.},

  pages = {226--256},
  abstract = {A global-mean model of coupled neutral and ion chemistry on Titan
	has been developed. Unlike the previous coupled models, the model
	involves ambipolar diffusion and escape of ions, hydrodynamic escape
	of light species, and calculates the H2 and CO densities near the
	surface that were assigned in some previous models. We tried to reduce
	the numbers of species and reactions in the model and remove all
	species and reactions that weakly affect the observed species. Hydrocarbon
	chemistry is extended to C12H10 for neutrals and C10H+11 for ions
	but does not include PAHs. The model involves 415 reactions of 83
	neutrals and 33 ions, effects of magnetospheric electrons, protons,
	and cosmic rays. UV absorption by Titan's haze was calculated using
	the Huygens observations and a code for the aggregate particles.
	Hydrocarbon, nitrile, and ion chemistries are strongly coupled on
	Titan, and attempt to calculate them separately (e.g., in models
	of ionospheric composition) may result in significant error. The
	model densities of various species are typically in good agreement
	with the observations except vertical profiles in the stratosphere
	that are steeper than the CIRS limb data. (A model with eddy diffusion
	that facilitates fitting to the CIRS limb data is considered as well.)
	The CO densities are supported by the O+ flux from Saturn's magnetosphere.
	The ionosphere includes a peak at 80 km formed by the cosmic rays,
	steplike layers at 500-700 and 700-900 km and a peak at 1060 km (SZA
	= 60°). Nighttime densities of major ions agree with the INMS data.
	Ion chemistry dominates in the production of bicyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
	above 600 km. The model estimates of heavy positive and negative
	ions are in reasonable agreement with the Cassini results. The major
	haze production is in the reactions C6H + C4H2, C3N + C4H2, and condensation
	of hydrocarbons below 100 km. Overall, precipitation rate of the
	photochemical products is equal to 4-7 kg[thin space]cm-2[thin space]Byr-1
	(50-90 m[thin space]Byr-1 while the global-mean depth of the organic
	sediments is ~3 m). Escape rates of methane and hydrogen are 2.9
	and 1.4 kg[thin space]cm-2[thin space]Byr-1, respectively. The model
	does not support the low C/N ratio observed by the Huygens ACP in
	Titan's haze.},

	CH4 thermospheric mixing ratio on Titan could vary as much as 35-40%
	due to ion-neutral chemical reactions. A new vertical methane profile
	has been computed by simultaneously modifying the stratospheric methane
	mixing ratio and the K(z) previously considered by Lara et al. (1996)
	and Banaszkiewicz et al. (2000a,b). A satisfactory fit of the methane
	thermospheric abundance and stratospheric mixing ratio of other minor
	constituents is achieved by placing the homopause at ~1000 km and
	increasing the methane stratospheric mixing ratio (qCH4) up to 3.8%.
	The new proposed eddy diffusion coefficient steadily rises from 1×107
	cm2 s-1 at 700 km to 1×1010 cm2 s-1 at 1500 km, whereas the stratospheric
	values are in the range (4-20)×103 cm2 s-1. Other likely ionization
	sources that can influence the methane distribution are (i) a metallic
	ion layer produced by micrometeoroid infall and (ii) frequent X-rays
	solar flares. Analysis of the effects of these ionization sources
	on the methane distribution indicates that, unlike previously assumed,
	CH4 can suffer considerable variations. These variations, although
	proved in this work, must be cautiously regarded since several assumptions
	have to be made on the rate of N2 and CH4 ionization by the processes
	previously mentioned. Hence, these results are only indicative of
	methane sensitivity to ionospheric chemistry.},

  abstract = {Benzene has recently been observed in the atmosphere of Jupiter, Saturn
	and also Titan. This compound is required as a precursor for larger
	aromatic species (PAHs) that may be part of aerosol particles. Several
	photochemical models have tried to reproduce the observed quantities
	of benzene in the atmospheres of Jupiter (both low- and high-latitudes
	regions), Saturn and Titan. In this present work, we have conducted
	a sensitivity study of benzene and PAHs formation, using similar
	photochemical schemes both for Titan and Jupiter (low-latitudes conditions).
	Two different photochemical schemes are used, for which the modeled
	composition fairly agrees with observational constraints, both for
	Jupiter and Titan. Some disagreements are specific to each atmospheric
	case, which may point to needed improvements, especially in kinetic
	data involved in the corresponding chemical cycles. The observed
	benzene mole fraction in Titan's stratosphere is reproduced by the
	model, but in the case of Jupiter, low-latitudes benzene abundance
	is only 3% of the observed column density, which may indicate a possible
	influence of latitudinal transport, since abundance of benzene is
	much higher in auroral regions. Though, the photochemical scheme
	of C6 compounds at temperature and pressure conditions of planetary
	atmospheres is still very uncertain. Several variations are therefore
	done on key reactions in benzene production. These variations show
	that benzene abundance is mainly sensitive to reactions that may
	affect the propargyl radical. The effect of aerosol production on
	hydrocarbons composition is also tested, as well as possible heterogenous
	recombination of atomic hydrogen in the case of Titan. PAHs are a
	major pathway for aerosol production in both models. The mass production
	profiles for aerosols are discussed for both Titan and Jupiter. Total
	production mass fluxes are roughly three times the one expected by
	observational constraints in both cases. Such comparative studies
	are useful to bring more constraints on photochemical models.},

  abstract = {Using a one-dimensional model, we investigate the hydrogen budget
	and escape to space in Titan's atmosphere. Our goal is to study in
	detail the distributions and fluxes of atomic and molecular hydrogen
	in the model, while identifying sources of qualitative and quantitative
	uncertainties. Our study confirms that the escape of atomic and molecular
	hydrogen to space is limited by the diffusion through the homopause
	level. The H distribution and flux inside the atmosphere are very
	sensitive to the eddy diffusion coefficient used above altitude 600
	km. We chose a high value of this coefficient 1 × 108 cm2 s-1 and
	a homopause level around altitude 900 km. We find that H flows down
	significantly from the production region above 500 km to the region
	[300-500] km, where it recombines into H2. Production of both H and
	H2 also occurs in the stratosphere, mostly from photodissociation
	of acetylene. The only available observational data to be compared
	are the escape rate of H deduced from Pioneer 11 and IUE observations
	of the H torus 1-3 × 109 cm-2 s-1 and the latest retrieved value
	of the H2 mole fraction in the stratosphere: (1.1 ± 0.1) × 10-3.
	Our results for both of these values are at least 50-100% higher,
	though the uncertainties within the chemical schemes and other aspects
	of the model are large. The chemical conversion from H to H2 is essentially
	done through catalytic cycles using acetylene and diacetylene. We
	have studied the role of this diacetylene cycle, for which the associated
	reaction rates are poorly known. We find that it mostly affects C4
	species and benzene in the lower atmosphere, rather than the H profile
	and the hydrogen budget. We have introduced the heterogenous recombination
	of hydrogen on the surface of aerosol particles in the stratosphere,
	and this appears to be a significant process, comparable to the chemical
	processes. It has a major influence on the H distribution, and consequently
	on several other species, especially C3H4, C4H2 and C6H6. Therefore,
	this heterogenous process should be taken into account when trying
	to understand the stratospheric distribution of these hydrocarbons.},

  abstract = {The problem of Pluto's atmosphere thermal structure, as determined
	from the June 9, 1988 occultation data, is reassessed in the light
	of the detection of N2 and CO ices, along with CH4, on Pluto's surface
	and of recent surface temperature measurements. Firm inferences from
	these observations are that N2 must be the major gas of Pluto's atmosphere
	and that the temperature at the microbar level is about 105 K. We
	estimate that CH4 and CO are present at the 0.1% level of N2 in the
	atmosphere and we develop simple 1-D aeronomical models (solving
	the heat equation) for various atmospheric cases. It is found in
	particular that (i) if CO cooling is omitted, heating by CH4 can
	explain the temperature rise between the surface and the [mu]bar
	level, but not the drop-off observed in several occultation lightcurves
	below 1215 km, unless the CH4 mixing ratio is larger than 10%; (ii)
	if, as expected, CO is present at the [approximate]0.1% level, and
	CH4 is lower than 10%, then cooling by CO rotational lines is so
	large that CH4 heating cannot explain a 105 K temperature at 1-2
	[mu]bar. A possible way to explain the temperature rise between the
	surface and 1 [mu]bar and the lightcurve drop-off is to invoke heating
	by a Titan-like haze layer with extinction optical depth [approximate](0.4-4)
	x 10-3 for particle sizes in the range 0.01-2 [mu]m. Such a haze
	can plausibly result from methane photolysis and subsequent chemistry,
	provided that the CH4 mixing ratio is significantly larger than 10-4.
	A similar haze is not expected to be present on Triton (where the
	methane mixing ratio is about (2-20) x 10-5), which is consistent
	with the fact that Triton's atmosphere near the [mu]bar level is
	much colder than Pluto's. Estimating production and fallout time
	constants suggests that haze particles in Pluto's atmosphere must
	be small (<=0.1 [mu]m).},

	CH4 is the most abundant neutral after nitrogen. In this paper, the
	complex doublet potential-energy surface related to the reaction
	between HCN+ and CH4 is investigated at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p), CCSD(T)/6-311G++(3df,2pd)(single-point),
	and QCISD/6-311G(d,p) computational levels. A total of seven products
	are located on the PES. The initial association of HCN+ with CH4
	is found to be a prereaction complex 1 (HCNHCH3+) without barrier.
	Starting from 1, the most feasible pathway is the direct H-abstraction
	process (the internal C-H bond dissociation) leading to the product
	P1 (HCNH++CH3). By C-C addition, prereaction complex 1 can form intermediate
	2 (HNCHCH3+) and then lead to the product P2 (CH3CNH++H). The rate-controlling
	step of this process is only 25.6 kcal/mol. It makes the Path P2
	(1) R 1 TS1/2 2 TS2/P2 P2 another possible way for the reaction.
	P3 (HCNCH3+ + H), P5 (cNCHCH2+ + H2), and P6 (NCCH3+ + H2) are exothermic
	products, but they have higher barriers (more than 40.0 kcal/mol);
	P4 (H + HCN + CH3+) and P7 (H + H2 + HCCNH+) are endothermic products.
	They should be discovered under different experimental or interstellar
	conditions. The present study may be helpful for investigating the
	analogous ion-molecule reaction in Titan's atmosphere.},

  abstract = {We report on the discovery of emissions due to carbon monoxide from
	Titan's atmosphere, from mid-infrared observations with the ISAAC
	spectrometer at the Very Large Telescope and covering the 4.50-4.85
	[mu]m range. We detected about 45 emission lines coinciding with
	CO ro-vibrational lines, including CO(1-0) (P18 to R11) and CO(2-1)
	(P11 to R11). We show that these emissions cannot be generated thermally
	but occur in non-LTE conditions, due to radiative de-excitation from
	the v=1 and v=2 CO levels after excitation at 4.7 and 2.3 [mu]m by
	solar radiation. A complete fluorescence model is then developed,
	allowing to compute the state populations of the two most abundant
	CO isotopes and N2(1). It includes absorption by CO and CH4, and
	vibrational-thermal and vibrational-vibrational collisional exchanges
	with CO, N2, CH4, and H2. Emerging radiances at the top of the atmosphere
	are evaluated with a line-by-line code and compared to observations.
	Contribution functions show that the CO emissions sound Titan's stratosphere:
	while the (1-0) lines generally probe two layers, located respectively
	at 100-250 km and 300-550 km, the (2-1) lines are sensitive to the
	intermediate layer at 150-300 km. A sensitivity study is performed
	to establish the effect of the main model parameters (temperature
	profile, collisional scenario, and CO stratospheric abundance) on
	the results. Models reproduce the essential structure of the observed
	emissions. The (1-0) fundamental band is generally well fit with
	a nominal CO mixing ratio of 32 ppm--as inferred in the troposphere
	from observations at 4.80-5.10 [mu]m (Lellouch et al., 2003, Icarus
	162, 126-143). However, this band is only weakly dependent on the
	CO abundance, and given temperature and collisional scenario uncertainties,
	it constrains the CO stratospheric mixing ratio only to within a
	factor of ~3. In addition, the nominal model with 32 ppm CO underestimates
	the first hot (2-1) transition by approximately a factor of 2. This
	discrepancy can be resolved by a combined adjustment of collisional
	rates and an increased CO stratospheric ratio of 60 ppm, consistent
	with the determination of Gurwell and Muhleman (2000, Icarus 145,
	653-656). In contrast, the CO vertical profile suggested by Hidayat
	et al. (1998, Icarus 133, 109-133), strongly depleted above 200 km,
	cannot match the data for any realistic collisional scenario, and
	is therefore not supported by our results.},

	allowed for a range of possibilities, including pure CH4 oceans.
	The Voyage 1 flyby ruled out this last possibility, replacing it
	with compelling observational arguments in favor of a mixed light-hydrocarbon
	and N ocean. Ground-based radar observations indicated a surprisingly
	reflective surface, inconsistent with a hydrocarbon ocean and more
	reminiscent of the Galilean satellites. Nonetheless, passive radiometric
	measurements of the surface do not support the notion that Titan's
	surface is like that of the Galilean satellites. One of the arguments
	against hydrocarbon oceans reflecting radar energy is that most solid,
	complex hydrocarbons and nitriles will be denser than the liq. and
	sink. Nonetheless, many of the aerosol species will coagulate in
	highly non-spherical patterns, and some species probably polymerize
	in long chains. Such chains will have very low sedimentation velocities
	in the ocean, and may remain near the surface through ocean mixing
	process. The prospect of an oceanic \"soup\" of polar polymers acting
	as vol. reflectors at radio wavelengths suggests that the interpretation
	of radar observations needs reevaluation. [on SciFinder (R)]},

  abstract = {Recently published nitrogen and hydrogen isotopic data were analyzed
	to constrain the initial volatile abundances on Saturn's giant moon
	Titan. The nitrogen data are interpreted in terms of a model of non-thermal
	escape processes that lead to enhancement in the heavier isotope.
	The authors show that these data do not, in fact, strongly constrain
	the abundance of nitrogen present in Titan's early atm., and that
	a wide range of initial atm. masses (all larger than the present
	value) can yield the measured enhancement. The enrichment in deuterated
	methane is now much better detd. than it was when Pinto et al. (1986)
	first proposed a photochem. mechanism to preferentially retain the
	deuterium. A simple linear theory is developed to provide a more
	reliable est. of the relative dissocn. rates of normal and deuterated
	methane. The improved data and models are used to compute initial
	methane reservoirs consistent with the obsd. enhancement. The result
	of this anal. agrees with an independent est. for the initial methane
	abundance based solely on the present-day rate of photolysis and
	an assumption of steady state. This consistency in reservoir size
	is necessary but not sufficient to infer that methane photolysis
	has proceeded steadily over the age of the solar system to produce
	large quantities of less volatile orgs. The anal. indicates an epoch
	of early atm. escape of nitrogen, followed by a later addn. of methane
	by outgassing from the interior. The results also suggest that Titan's
	volatile inventory came in part or largely from a circum-Saturnian
	disk of material more reducing than the surrounding solar nebula.
	Many of the ambiguities inherent in the present anal. can be resolved
	through Cassini-Huygens data and a program of lab. studies on isotopic
	and mol. exchange processes. The value of, and interest in, the Cassini-Huygens
	data can be greatly enhanced if such a program were undertaken prior
	to the prime phase of the mission. [on SciFinder (R)]},

  abstract = {A theor. study was made on the interaction of energetic H, He, C,
	and Fe ions from solar wind and cosmic rays with the atm. of Titan,
	a satellite of planet Saturn. It was based on computer simulation
	of binary collisions with the program MARLOWE in a kind of Monte
	Carlo calcn. Two main issues were discussed. Firstly, the prodn.
	of energetic secondary atoms with energies exceeding 0.5 eV by knock
	on processes and the range of the primary ions in a model lattice
	contg. the atm. components nitrogen, argon, and methane in 3 mixts.
	was modeled. Secondly, the model calcn. was applied to Titan's atm.
	using the range of primaries and the barometric formula in a 10 km
	bin arrangement. A distribution profile of secondary N, C, and H
	atoms resulted, depending on the kind and energy of primary ions.
	The MARLOWE program had to be modified for the application to a gas
	phase and high energy collisions. The latter was achieved by introducing
	the Bethe-Bloch formalism and relativistic corrections to inelastic
	loss calcn. Results show that heavy primary particles (C, Fe) produce
	very high nos. of secondaries. This counterbalances their low abundance
	in space radiation in view of chem. effects. An interesting result
	was that light primaries with 108 eV and heavy ones even up to 1010
	eV dissipate their energy mainly within Titan's atm. and do not reach
	the solid surface. For a 98% N2 and 2% CH4 mixt. the column d. of
	all hot atoms generated by space particle radiation from H to Fe
	was calcd. to about 2*109 cm-2s-1. An important contribution of these
	hot atoms can be expected locally in the actual atm. On a global
	scale in the change from a primordial to the existing atm. during
	the lifetime of the solar system, the no. d. of these suprathermal
	atoms amounted to ~ 2*1026 cm-2, i.e. the total column d. of the
	atm., which implies that each atom once had been a suprathermal atom.
	The study was complemented by an exptl. approach. Hot chem. reactions
	of secondary atoms were studied by 32 MeV 3He2+ ions from Juelich

	apparitions. Spectral resoln., achieved by using a series of narrow-band
	interference filters, ranged from 0.02 m in the uv to 0.05 m in the
	ir. The 60-in. (152 cm) and 100-in. (254 cm) telescopes on Mount
	Wilson were used. All satellites except Titan show evidence of synchronous
	rotation. Tethys, Dione, and Rhea all show some variation in brightness
	with orbital phase, their leading sides being 10-20% brighter than
	their trailing sides. No change in Titan's brightness with phase
	was obsd. The large change in Iapetus's brightness with orbital phase
	was confirmed. Iapetus shows significant variation in its spectrum
	with orbital phase, with its darker side \"redder\" than the brighter
	side by at least 15% between 0.4 and 0.8 m. All of the satellites
	except Titan have similar reflection spectra, relatively const. from
	0.4 to 0.8 m and then decreasing from 0.8 to 1.1 m. Dione shows the
	largest decrease in the ir with a decrease of .apprx.15% from 0.8
	to 1.0 m. The reflection spectra of these 4 satellites are consistent
	with what is known of H2O and NH3 frost spectra in the spectral range
	0.4-1.1 m. The satellite spectra are not similar to spectra for most
	ferrosilicates; nor are they similar to spectra of the Moon, Mars,
	or the Galilean satellites. More surprisingly, the satellite spectra
	in this spectral region are quite different from the spectrum of
	Saturn's rings, where water ice has been identified in ir spectra.
	This difference implies the presence of some materials in the rings
	which are absent on the satellite surfaces. Titan's spectrum is also
	different from the spectra of the other satellites, but it is similar
	to the spectrum of Saturn's equatorial belt. This suggests that material
	present in the optical surface of Saturn's belt is similar to materials
	on Titan, perhaps on Titan's surface. CH4 absorptions affect both
	the belt spectrum and Titan's spectrum beyond 0.6 m. The Saturn and
	Titan spectra differ in the uv. Rayleigh scattering in gases above
	an uv haze layer (about 10 km-atm H2) can account for the uv turnup
	in Saturn's spectrum. There is much less Rayleigh scattering on Titan,
	which suggests a thin (10-1000 m-atm) atm., through which the surface
	may be visible. [on SciFinder (R)]},

  abstract = {Atoms which escape Titan's atmosphere are unlikely to possess escape
	velocity from Saturn, and can orbit the planet until lost by ionization
	or collision with Titan. It is predicted that a toroidal ring of
	between ~1 and ~103 atoms or molecules cm-3 exists around Saturn
	at a distance of about 10 times the radius of the visible rings.
	This torus may be detectable from Earth-orbit and detection of nondetection
	of it may provide some information about the presence or absence
	of a Saturnian magnetic field, and the exospheric temperature and
	atmospheric escape rate of Titan. It is estimated that, if Titan
	has a large exosphere, ~97% or more of the escaping atoms can be
	recaptured by Titan, thereby decreasing the effective net atmospheric
	loss rate by up to two orders of magnitude. With such a reduction
	in atmospheric loss rates, it becomes more plausible to suggest that
	satellites previously thought too small to retain an atmosphere may
	have one. It is suggested that Saturn be examined by Lyman-[alpha]
	and other observations to search for the gaseous torus of Titan.
	If successful, these could then be extended to other satellites.
	The effect of a hypothetical Saturnian magnetosphere on the atmosphere
	of Titan is investigated. It is shown that, if Saturn has a magnetic
	field comparable to Jupiter's (~10 G at the planetary surface), the
	magnetospheric plasma can supply Titan with hydrogen at a rate comparable
	to the loss rates in some of the models of [Trafton, 1972] and [Sagan,
	1973]. A major part of the Saturnian ionospheric escape flux (~ 1027
	photoelectrons sec-1) could perhaps be captured by Titan. At the
	upper limit, this rate of hydrogen input to the satellite could total
	~0.1 atm pressure over the lifetime of the solar system, an amount
	comparable to estimates of the present atmospheric pressure of Titan.},

	A. These results are in excellent agreement with previous UV measurements
	from 2200-3300 A spanning two decades, but have a significantly higher
	signal to noise ratio and spectral resolution. We add ~400 A of new
	spectral information from 1800-2200 A, a wavelength region in which
	Titan has not been detected previously. The albedo above 2200 A is
	a factor of 1.18 higher in August 1992 than October 1991, which is
	most likely due to the 4.3[degree sign] difference in Titan's phase
	angle between the two dates. Below 2200 A the albedo decreases only
	modestly with decreasing wavelength and does not show unambiguous
	evidence for discrete spectral features characteristic of several
	of the known hydrocarbons, particularly acetylene (C2H2). Comparison
	of the albedo with best-fit models provides constraints on the optical
	properties and distribution of the small particle component of Titan's
	haze and on the C2H2mole fraction. The small particle haze seems
	to be darker in the UV than the "Titan" tholins analog produced in
	the laboratory, and the vertical extent limited to altitudes above
	~120-150 km. The acetylene distribution is consistent with the Voyager

	tholin, has a C/N ratio in the range of 2-4 and a C/H ratio of about
	unity. The haze significantly affects the thermal balance of Titan,
	causing an antigreenhouse effect that cools the surface by 9 K. Titan's
	faintly banded appearance suggests strong zonal winds in the lower
	stratosphere. Condensate clouds of ethane or methane, if present,
	are thin, patchy, or transient. Stratospheric clouds of condensed
	nitriles and (possibly) hydrocarbons appear to be assocd. with, though
	not contained entirely in, the polar shadow, suggesting abundances
	may vary with the season. Pptg. condensate particles from the stratosphere
	probably act as nucleating centers for the formation and rapid growth
	of methane ice particles in the troposphere, where the gas phase
	appears to be highly supersatd. Once formed, fallout times for these
	hailstones are .apprx.2 h or less. Melting, and possible subsequent
	fragmentation of methane raindrops, should occur at .apprx.12 km
	and below. Almost complete evapn. should occur just above the surface.
	A thin residue of ethane-enriched fog particles would then slowly
	settle to the surface, steadily modifying an existing surface or
	subsurface residue of liq. hydrocarbons. The optical properties of
	the haze in the 1 to 3 mm spectral region and the implications for
	the visibility of the surface are probably the most pressing current
	research questions. Other key questions include the nature of the
	high altitude detached haze layer, altitude and seasonal changes

	nuclei for clouds, and the nature of any condensate clouds. [on SciFinder

	The resulting enhancement in methane condensation lowers the upper

  abstract = {The reaction of carbon atoms in their 3Pj electronic ground state
	with hydrogen cyanide, HCN (X 1S+), is explored computationally to
	investigate the formation of hitherto undetected C2N isomers in the
	interstellar medium via a neutral-neutral reaction. Our ab initio
	calculations expose that the reaction has no entrance barrier and
	proceeds on the triplet surface via addition of the carbon atom to
	the p-bond, yielding a cyclic HC2N intermediate. This complex either
	decomposes to cyclic C2N plus atomic hydrogen or rearranges via ring
	opening to the HCNC or HCCN isomers. These molecules can fragment
	via atomic hydrogen ejection to the linear CCN (2P) and CNC (2Pg)
	radicals. The formation of all three C2N isomers proceeds without
	any exit barrier, but the reactions to form CNC, CCN, and c-C2N are
	found to be strongly endothermic by 52.7, 59.0, and 99.6 kJ mol-1,
	respectively. Based on these investigations, the neutral-neutral
	reaction of atomic carbon with hydrogen cyanide cannot synthesize
	C2N isomers in cold molecular clouds, where average translation temperatures
	of the reactants are only 10-15 K. However, the physical conditions
	in circumstellar envelopes of, for example, IRC+10216, differ strongly;
	close to the photosphere of the central star, temperatures can reach
	4000 K, and the elevated velocity of both reactants in the long tail
	of the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution can overcome the reaction endothermicity
	to form at least the linear CNC and CCN isomers. Therefore, these
	environments represent ideal targets to search for hitherto undetected
	CNC (2P) and CNC (2Pg) via either infrared or microwave spectroscopy.},

	determined at more than 100 levels of theory. Wave function procedures
	(HF, MP2, QCISD, QCISD(T), CCSD, and CCSD(T)) and a large and representative
	range of density functional theory (DFT) approaches (B3-LYP, BMK,
	EDF2, M05-2X, MPWB1K, O3-LYP, PBE, TPSS, etc.) have been examined
	in conjunction with basis sets such as 6-31G(d), 6-31+G(d,p), 6-31G(2df,p),
	6-311+G(d,p), and 6-311+G(2df,p). The vibrational frequency scale
	factors were determined by a comparison of theoretical harmonic frequencies
	with the corresponding experimental fundamentals utilizing a standard

	obtained from a comparison of the computed ZPVEs with experimental
	ZPVEs for a smaller standard set of 39 molecules, though the effect
	of expansion to a 48 molecule data set was also examined. In addition
	to evaluating the scale factors for a wide range of levels of theory,
	we have also probed the effect on scale factors of varying the percentage
	of incorporated exact exchange in hybrid DFT calculations using a
	modified B3-LYP functional. This has revealed a near-linear relationship
	between the magnitude of the scale factor and the proportion of exact
	exchange. Finally, we have investigated the effect of basis set size

	in interstellar clouds. We consider the chemistry and ionisation
	balance of large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) type molecules
	in diffuse clouds and show that certain PAH molecules can be doubly
	ionised by the interstellar ultraviolet radiation field. If recombination
	of the dications so produced with electrons is dissociative rather
	than radiative, then PAHs are rapidly destroyed. PAHs which can only
	be singly ionised have much smaller recombination energies and can
	be long lasting in these regions. This type of property may be very
	important in selecting the PAH species which can populate the general
	interstellar medium and account for certain of the diffuse bands
	observed in optical spectra. Destruction of PAH molecules via formation
	of dications may be responsible for the weakening of the diffuse
	bands observed in regions of high UV flux. We also discuss the chemistry
	of large, saturated molecules in hot molecular cores in star-forming
	regions. Here it appears that gas phase abundances are determined
	by surface chemistry on the cold ice mantles of interstellar grains.
	We present the preliminary results of a study of deuterium chemistry
	in these hot cores with the aim of probing both the detailed surface
	processes by which complex molecules are synthesised and the gas
	phase reactions which destroy them.},

  abstract = {Dissociative electron-ion recombination (DR) is an important ionization
	loss process and source of neutral reactive radicals in the interstellar
	medium (ISM) and many other molecular plasmas. Unfortunately, neutral
	products are difficult to identify with only about 40 distributions
	being reported in the literature. These have been obtained by spectroscopic
	techniques integrated with flowing afterglows (FA) and using storage
	rings (SR). The data obtained by SR measurements are more extensive
	than those determined in the FA. Some data are available where the
	two techniques overlap, however here there are very significant differences.
	To resolve these contradictions, a new technique to quantitatively
	detect product neutrals has been developed. This technique is based
	on the FA and uses an electron impact (EI) ionizer to ionize the
	neutral products prior to detection by a quadrupole mass filter/electron
	multiplier. Two experimental methodologies, both using pulsed gas
	techniques, isolate and quantify the DR products. In one approach,
	an electron attaching gas is pulsed into the flow to transiently
	destroy electrons and thus quench DR. N2H+ recombination has been
	used as a test case and results from this approach give an upper
	limit of 5% for the NH + N product channel, the remainder being N2 + H.
	In the second approach, the reagent gas N2 is pulsed. Here the absolute
	percentages of products are monitored versus initial N2 concentration.
	Results from this approach also give an upper limit of 5% for NH + N
	production. This establishes that N2 + H is the dominant channel,
	being at least 95%, and that there is no significant NH production.
	This was contrary to a recent storage ring measurement which yielded
	64% NH + N and 36% N2 + H. Note, that these values have changed due
	to a recent re-measurement of the DR revealing that the NH channel
	is not nearly as significant as originally thought. Additionally,
	the DR product distribution for CH5+ is reported and discussed.},

  abstract = {This study reports on the development and testing of a method of quantifying
	the uncertainties in concentration predictions by a complex photochemical
	grid model (PGM), using a modification of the basic Monte Carlo method
	(MCM). The computationally intensive aspects of applying a full MCM
	to hundreds of PGM inputs and model parameters is replaced by a highly
	restricted sampling approach that exploits the spatial persistence
	found in predicted concentration fields. The sampling approach to
	the MCM is being explored as an efficient approach to assess the
	uncertainty in the differences in predicted maximum ozone concentration
	between base case and control scenarios. The MCM is applied to several
	dozen surface cells, with the goal of sampling the spatial pattern
	of uncertainty in the PGM-predicted differences in surface ozone
	concentration fields between a pair of base and control scenarios.
	The uncertainty in model inputs and parameters is simulated using
	several types of stochastic models. These stochastic models are driven
	using Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) to generate a non-redundant
	ensemble of alternative model inputs. Preliminary testing of the
	sampled MCM approach was conducted using the UAM-IV PGM on the New
	York ozone attainment modeling domain for the 6-8 July 1988 ozone
	episode. One hundred alternative concentration estimates were generated
	for a base scenario and for control scenarios representing 50%, 10%
	and 5% reduction of NOx emissions. The upper and lower bounds of
	the concentration difference ensemble that define a 95% confidence
	range were spatially interpolated from 27 monitoring sites to the
	full (surface) modeling domain, using the field of zero uncertainty
	(ZU) concentration differences. For the 50% NOx control scenario,
	predicted increases in peak ozone concentration smaller than 20 ppb
	were generally not significant from zero. By contrast, predicted
	decreases in peak ozone greater than 10 ppb were usually significant.
	For a control scenario with a small 5% NOx reduction, predicted concentration
	differences and confidence intervals were much smaller, but predicted
	changes in peak ozone were significant at a number of sample cells.},

	We demonstrate that if carbon and nitrogen were in the form of CO
	and N2, resp., in the early subnebula, these mols. were not subsequently
	converted into CH4 and NH3 during the evolution of the disk, contrary
	to the current scenario initially proposed by Prinn and Fegley (1981,

	some CH4 and NH3, these gases were not subsequently converted into
	CO and N2. We argue that Titan must have been formed from planetesimals
	migrating from the outer part of the subnebula to the present orbit
	of the satellite. These planetesimals were relics of those embedded
	in the feeding zone of Saturn prior to the completion of the planet
	and contained hydrates of NH3 and clathrate hydrates of CH4. It is
	shown that, for plausible abundances of CH4 and NH3 in the solar
	nebula at 10 AU, the masses of methane and nitrogen trapped in Titan
	were higher than the est. of masses of these components in the primitive
	atm. of the satellite. If our scenario is valid and if our turbulent
	model properly describes the structure and the evolution of the actual
	subnebula of Saturn, the Xe/C ratio should be six times higher in
	Titan's atm. today than in the Sun, while the current scenario would

	We have used data from 13 targeted flybys of Titan (T5&#8211;T32)
	to construct an empirical model that describes the mean state of
	the thermosphere in the northern hemisphere, giving the N2 and CH4
	densities between 1000 and 1600 km as a function of latitude and
	height. The principal features in the INMS data are well reproduced
	by this simple model. We find a pronounced oblateness in the thermosphere,
	with densities above 1100 km altitude increasing by around 70% from
	the northern (winter) pole to the equator, resulting in isobaric
	surfaces being $\simeq$45 km higher over the equator than at the

	tend to decrease with height from 149 ± 10 K to 140 ± 13 K near 1600

	with primarily poleward flow at equatorial latitudes which, northward
	of around 60°N, is accompanied by a band of prograde zonal winds

	accurate and large-scale calculations, as reported. Another new development
	is the consideration of the unified nature of the recombination process
	in an ab initio manner, via resonances embedded in the electron-ion
	continua, which have been heretofore considered as separate processes
	of radiative recombination and dielectronic recombination. A single
	set of total electron-ion recombination rate coefficients is thereby
	obtained as a function of electron temperature. The present calculations
	also meet the hitherto neglected, but theoretically essential, criterion
	of self-consistency between the rates for the inverse processes of
	photoionization and recombination, ensured by describing all atomic
	processes with an identical set of eigenfunction expansion within
	the close-coupling approximation using the $\mathstrut{{\bmi R}}$-matrix
	method. Photoionization cross sections and total electron-ion recombination
	rate coefficients for the carbon and nitrogen isonuclear sequences,
	C I–C VI and N I–N VII, are presented. Ionization fractions in coronal
	equilibrium are also computed. The present photoionization cross
	sections have been calculated using more extensive eigenfunction
	expansions than those in the Opacity Project. In addition to the
	total photoionization and recombination data, state-specific cross
	sections are also obtained for a large number of excited states for
	non-LTE models. Complete data sets are available electronically.},

  abstract = {The atmosphere of Titan is constantly bombarded by galactic cosmic
	rays and Saturnian magnetospheric electrons causing the formation
	of free electrons and primary ions, which are then stabilized by
	ion cluster formation and charging of aerosols. These charged particles
	accumulate in drops in cloud regions of the troposphere. Their abundance
	can substantially increase by friction, fragmentation or collisions
	during convective activity. Charge sepn. occurs with help of convection
	and gravitational settling leading to development of elec. fields
	within the cloud and between the cloud and the ground. Neutralization
	of these charged particles leads to corona discharges which are characterized
	by low current densities. These elec. discharges could induce a no.
	of chem. reactions in the troposphere and hence it is of interest
	to explore such effects. The authors exptl. studied the corona discharge
	of a simulated Titan's atm. (10% methane and 2% argon in nitrogen)
	at 500 Torr and 298 K by GC-FTIR-MS techniques. The main products
	have been identified as hydrocarbons (ethane, ethyne, ethene, propane,
	propene + propyne, cyclopropane, butane, 2-methylpropane, 2-methylpropene,
	n-butane, 2-butene, 2,2-dimethylpropane, 2-methylbutane, 2-methylbutene,

	ethanenitrile, propanenitrile, 2-methylpropanenitrile and butanenitrile)
	and an uncharacterized film deposit. Their trends of formation as
	a function of discharge time are presented and their initial yields
	of formation are derived. These results clearly demonstrate that
	a complex org. chem. can be initiated by corona processes in the
	lower atm. Although photochem. and charged particle chem. occurring
	in the stratosphere can account for many of the obsd. hydrocarbon
	species in Titan, the predicted abundance of ethene is too low by
	a factor of 10 to 40. While some ethene will be produced by charged-particle
	chem., its prodn. by corona processes and subsequent diffusion into
	the stratosphere appears to be an adequate source. Because little

  abstract = {We have observed Titan in a series of campaigns from 1991 to 1996
	with the Fourier Transform Spectrometer on the CFH telescope. The
	data acquired provide a lightcurve from the geometric albedos in
	the 0.9- spectral region. The 1991-1993 data were previously analyzed
	in Coustenis et al. [1995. Titan's surface: composition and variability
	from its near-infrared albedo. Icarus 118, 87-104] with a spherical
	particle code by McKay et al. [1989. The thermal structure of Titan's
	atmosphere. Icarus 80, 23-53]. We present here three new datasets
	from the 1994, 1995 and 1996 observations, with additional information
	from the 0.94-[mu]m methane window on Titan. All the data (1991-1996)
	are re-analyzed in this work using an updated radiative transfer
	code based on Rannou et al. [2003. A model of Titan's haze of fractal
	aerosols constrained by multiple observations. Planet. Space Sci.
	51, 963-976] with fractal particles. A comparative study of methane
	absorption coefficients currently available from different sources
	is also performed demonstrating the great sensitivity of surface
	inferences to this model parameter. Based on our results, we recommend
	the methane absorption coefficients produced by Boudon et al. [2006.

	from 2000 to and implications for interpretation of outer planet
	spectra. Icarus 181, 309-319.] for future studies of Titan. The geometric
	albedos have been reproduced with our model. We have tested different
	types of haze profiles and inferred the impact of this parameter
	on the retrieval of surface albedos. The latter are finally proposed
	in the atmospheric methane windows centered at 0.94, 1.075, 1.28,
	1.6 and for each of the methane coefficient sets. The surface albedos
	proposed here are not just points at the center of the windows but
	curves covering a large portion of these regions. This is useful
	for studies of the composition of the Titan surface. Indeed, we find
	our data to be compatible with mixtures of water ice and tholin but
	have strong indication for the presence of an additional, as yet
	unidentified, component (or components) for which we offer a spectral
	description. We also discuss the implications of the surface albedo
	retrievals (as a disk average) for the surface of Titan, recently
	investigated by the Cassini-Huygens mission.},

  howpublished = {CODAWORK'08},
  month = {May},
  year = {2008},
  note = {Girona: La Universitat},
  abstract = {The Dirichlet family owes its privileged status within simplex distributions
	to easyness of interpretation and good mathematical properties. In
	particular, we recall fundamental properties for the analysis of
	compositional data such as closure under amalgamation and subcomposition.
	From a probabilistic point of view, it is characterised (uniquely)
	by a variety of independence relationships which makes it indisputably
	the reference model for expressing the non trivial idea of substantial
	independence for compositions. Indeed, its well known inadequacy
	as a general model for compositional data stems from such an independence
	structure together with the poorness of its parametrisation. In this
	paper a new class of distributions (called Flexible Dirichlet) capable
	of handling various dependence structures and containing the Dirichlet
	as a special case is presented. The new model exhibits a considerably
	richer parametrisation which, for example, allows to model the means
	and (part of) the variance-covariance matrix separately. Moreover,
	such a model preserves some good mathematical properties of the Dirichlet,
	i.e. closure under amalgamation and subcomposition with new parameters
	simply related to the parent composition parameters. Furthermore,
	the joint and conditional distributions of subcompositions and relative
	totals can be expressed as simple mixtures of two Flexible Dirichlet
	distributions. The basis generating the Flexible Dirichlet, though
	keeping compositional invariance, shows a dependence structure which
	allows various forms of partitional dependence to be contemplated
	by the model (e.g. non-neutrality, subcompositional dependence and
	subcompositional non-invariance), independence cases being identified
	by suitable parameter configurations. In particular, within this
	model substantial independence among subsets of components of the
	composition naturally occurs when the subsets have a Dirichlet distribution.},

  abstract = {The dissociative recombination reaction between HC3NH+ and electrons
	is an important process in the chemistry of interstellar clouds.
	Motivated by the evidence that HCN and its metastable isomer HNC
	are both formed via the dissociative recombination reaction of HCNH+,
	we have examined the potential energy surface for the dissociation
	of the transient HC3NH following the recombination between HC3NH+
	and electrons. We find that HC3NH+ gains 151 kcal mol-1 energy by
	the neutralization; this energy is high enough to isomerize HC3NH
	to HCCNCH, as well as to dissociate a hydrogen atom from either end
	of the molecule. The present calculation suggests, therefore, that
	the metastable linear and near-linear isomers of HC3N, namely, HNC3,
	HCCNC, and HCNCC, can be formed via the dissociative recombination
	between HC3NH+ and electrons. Two of these isomers, HNC3 and HCCNC,
	have already been detected in the dark cloud TMC-1. The unobserved
	species HCNCC is energetically the least stable. Since interstellar
	HC3N molecules are synthesized predominantly via neutral-neutral
	reactions, the HC3NH+ + e- process serves mainly to produce the metastable
	isomers of HC3N. We have incorporated these reaction products, as
	well as other relevant ion-molecule and neutral-neutral reactions,
	into our new standard model of dense interstellar clouds. Our model
	results show that the observed abundances in TMC-1 of HC3N, its two
	detected metastable isomers, and the related species C3H, C3N, and
	HC3NH+ can, in the main, be reproduced.},

	various hydrocarbons (CH4, C2H2, C2H4, C2H6, and C3H8) have been
	studied in a uniform supersonic flow expansion over the temperature
	range 24300 K. Rate coefficients have been obtained by using the
	pulsed laser photolysis-laser induced fluorescence technique, where
	both radicals were produced at the same time but detected separately.
	The reactivity of the triplet state was found to be significantly
	lower than that of the singlet ground state for all reactants over
	the whole temperature range of the study. Whereas C2(X1£g+) reacts
	with a rate coefficient close to the gas kinetic limit with all hydrocarbons
	studied apart from CH4, C2(a3 u) appears to be more sensitive to
	the molecular and electronic structure of the reactant partners.
	The latter reacts at least one order of magnitude faster with unsaturated
	hydrocarbons than with alkanes, and the rate coefficients increase
	very significantly with the size of the alkane. Results are briefly
	discussed in terms of their potential astrophysical impact.},

	Contrary to previous studies [Sagan and Chyba, 1997], we find that

	have been rapidly photolyzed and should not have been sufficiently
	abundant to augment the atm. greenhouse effect. We also examine the

	and bolometric albedos of Uranus and Neptune by fitting a wide range
	of aerosol model atmospheres to their obsd. geometric albedo spectra.
	These models are characterized by an upper haze layer of finite optical
	depth and a lower cloud layer of infinite optical depth at discrete
	altitudes. Alternative models differ in the assumed value of the
	particles' single scattering phase function and the wavelength dependence
	of the haze optical depth. Phase functions ranging from isotropic
	to those characteristic of particles in the atmospheres of Titan,
	Jupiter, and Saturn are considered. The models of Uranus were partially
	tested by comparing the dependence of their disk-integrated brightness
	on phase angle with that derived from a combination of ground-based
	and Voyager 1 data that span phase angles of 0-85 Deg and by comparing
	their predicted shapes of several H2 quadrupole lines with obsd.
	shapes. Predictions of the Neptune models were compared with detns.
	of the planet's disk-integrated brightness at 0-48 Deg phase angle.
	The derived model parameters lie within useful bounds. In the case
	of Uranus, the cloud pressure for all 7 models considered falls between
	2.2 and 2.5 bars, implying CH4 mixing ratios in the deeper portion
	of the atm. that are >=30 times higher than expected from solar elemental
	abundances if the cloud is interpreted as being a CH4 condensation
	cloud. The range of haze pressure (?0.5 bars) and optical depth (0.06-0.6
	at 0.6435 mm) imply that haze aerosols are a significant absorber
	of sunlight and hence constitute a significant heating source in
	Uranus's upper troposphere and stratosphere. The results imply that
	the meteor. regimes in the observable atmospheres of Uranus and Neptune
	may be very different, with internal heat flux playing a more important

	of e with temperature above 200 K, with an average value of e(N2H+)
	= 2.8 × 10-7 cm3 s-1. The temperature variation for T ~ 100-300 K
	observed for e(HCO+) is similar to that of N2H+ ions for T ~ 300-500
	K. The smaller rate coefficient measured for DCO+ and N2D+ ions shows
	the influence of an isotope effect. The substantial enhancement of
	the vibrational level, ' = 6, from the N2B state for N2H+ recombination
	over N2D+ recombination is consistent with previous result at 300
	K and implies the influence of a tunneling mechanism of DR.},

  abstract = {Bayesian methods are experiencing increased use for probabilistic
	ecological modelling. Most Bayesian inference requires the numerical
	approximation of analytically intractable integrals. Two methods
	based on Monte Carlo simulation have appeared in the ecological/environmental
	modelling literature. Though they sound similar, the Bayesian Monte
	Carlo (BMC) and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are very
	different in their efficiency and effectiveness in providing useful
	approximations for accurate inference in Bayesian applications. We
	compare these two methods using a low-dimensional biochemical oxygen
	demand decay model as an example. We demonstrate that the BMC is
	extremely inefficient because the prior parameter distribution, from
	which the Monte Carlo sample is drawn, is often a poor surrogate
	for the posterior parameter distribution, particularly if the parameters
	are highly correlated. In contrast, MCMC generates a chain that converges,
	in distribution, on the posterior parameter distribution, that can
	be regarded as a sample from the posterior distribution. The inefficiency
	of the BMC can lead to marginal posterior parameter distributions
	that appear irregular and may be highly misleading because the important
	region of the posterior distribution may never be sampled. We also
	point out that a priori specification of the model error variance
	can strongly influence the estimation of the principal model parameters.
	Although the BMC does not require that the model error variance be
	specified, most published applications have treated this variance
	as a known constant. Finally, we note that most published BMC applications
	have chosen a uniform prior distribution, making the BMC more similar
	to a likelihood-based inference rather than a Bayesian method because
	the posterior is unaffected by the prior. Though other prior distributions
	could be applied, the treatment of Monte Carlo samples with any other
	choice of prior distribution has not been discussed in the BMC literature.},

	(v = 0) this implies that 2D + 2D is the main reaction channel; for
	N2+ (v = 1) a minor channel could be 2P + 2D, 2P being then quenched
	toward 2D by electrons. In a second experiment, at higher electron
	densities, the influence of superelastic collisions was studied;
	a steady state analysis yields the quenching rate coefficient k4,
	of 2D towards 4S equal to 2.4 × 10-10 cm3 s-1for Te = 3900 K and
	shows that 2D + 2D is always the major channel of the reaction for
	N2+ (v = 1), 2D + 2P being a minor channel. All these results are
	in good agreement with thermospheric models but imply that N2+ dissociative
	recombination is a less important source for nitrogen escape of Mars.},

	New insights into Titan's ionosphere are being facilitated by data

	lower (<1100 km) altitudes, the total ion densities measured by the
	INMS are less than the electron densities measured by the RPWS/LP

	not able to detect. Qualitatively, INMS spectra exhibit the same
	ion species and 12 amu family separations for the dayside ionospheres

	(due to lower electron densities and affecting heavier ion species
	more than lighter ones), and transport of longer-lived high mass

	dielec. const. values for the Cassini radar wavelength (.apprx.2.2

	condensation at low altitudes) to surface models, we find the following

	significant attenuation that can reach -50 dB, well below the sensitivity

	not be able to measure echoes coming from the surface. We thus warn
	about possible risks of misinterpretation if a \"wet atm.\" is not

	the optimization of future catalyst and reactor systems for biomass
	upgrade to fuels and chemicals. Pt-catalyzed decomposition of glycolaldehyde,
	as the smallest oxygenate with alcohol and aldehyde functionality,
	was studied via a DFT-based microkinetic model. It was found that
	two decomposition pathways exist. Under conditions of low hydrogen
	surface coverage, the initial C-H bond breaking reaction to HOCH(2)CO*
	is prevalent, while under conditions of high hydrogen coverage, the
	rather unexpected O-H bond forming reaction to HOCH(2)CHOH* is more
	active (subsequent decomposition is energetically favorable from
	HOCH(2)CHOH*). Our results indicate the possibility that (de)hydrogenation
	chemistry is rate-controlling in many small polyoxygenate biomass
	derivatives, and suitable catalysts are needed. Finally, DFT was
	used to understand the increased decomposition activity observed
	on the surface segregated Ni-Pt-Pt bimetallic catalyst. It was found
	that the initial O-H bond breaking of glycolaldehyde to OCH(2)CHO*
	has an activation barrier of just 0.21 eV. This barrier is lower
	than that of any glycolaldehyde consuming reaction on Pt. These computational
	predictions are in qualitative agreement with experimental results.},

  abstract = {Rank transformations are frequently employed in numerical experiments
	involving a computational model, especially in the context of sensitivity
	and uncertainty analyses. Response surface replacement and parameter
	screening are tasks which may benefit from a rank transformation.
	Ranks can cope with nonlinear (albeit monotonic) input-output distributions,
	allowing the use of linear regression techniques. Rank transformed
	statistics are more robust, and provide a useful solution in the
	presence of long tailed input and output distributions. As is known
	to practitioners, care must be employed when interpreting the results
	of such analyses, as any conclusion drawn using ranks does not translate
	easily to the original model. In the present note an heuristic approach
	is taken, to explore, by way of practical examples, the effect of
	a rank transformation on the outcome of a sensitivity analysis. An
	attempt is made to identify trends, and to correlate these effects
	to a model taxonomy. Employing sensitivity indices, whereby the total
	variance of the model output is decomposed into a sum of terms of
	increasing dimensionality, we show that the main effect of the rank
	transformation is to increase the relative weight of the first order
	terms (the `main effects'), at the expense of the `interactions'
	and `higher order interactions'. As a result the influence of those
	parameters which influence the output mostly by way of interactions
	may be overlooked in an analysis based on the ranks. This difficulty
	increases with the dimensionality of the problem, and may lead to
	the failure of a rank based sensitivity analysis. We suggest that
	the models can be ranked, with respect to the complexity of their
	input-output relationship, by mean of an `Association' index Iy.
	Iy may complement the usual model coefficient of determination Ry2
	as a measure of model complexity for the purpose of uncertainty and
	sensitivity analysis.},

  abstract = {A review. Heating occurs in Titan's stratosphere from the absorption
	of incident solar radiation by methane and aerosols. About 10% of
	the incident sunlight reaches Titan's surface and causes heating
	there. Thermal radiation redistributes heat within the atm. and cools
	to space. The resulting vertical temp. profile is stable against
	convection and a state of radiative equil. is established. Equating
	theor. and obsd. temp. profiles enables an empirical detn. of the
	vertical distribution of thermal opacity. A uniformly mixed aerosol
	is responsible for most of the opacity in the stratosphere, whereas
	collision-induced absorption of gases is the main contributor in
	the troposphere. Occasional clouds are obsd. in the troposphere in
	spite of the large degrees of methane supersatn. found there. Photochem.
	converts CH4 and N2 into more complex hydrocarbons and nitriles in
	the stratosphere and above. Thin ice clouds of trace orgs. are formed
	in the winter and early spring polar regions of the lower stratosphere.
	Pptg. ice particles serve as condensation sites for supersatd. methane
	vapor in the troposphere below, resulting in lowered methane degrees
	of supersatn. in the polar regions. Latitudinal variations of stratospheric
	temp. are seasonal, and lag instantaneous response to solar irradn.
	by about one season for two reasons: (1) an actual instantaneous
	thermal response to a latitudinal distribution of absorbing gases,
	themselves out of phase with the sun by about one season, and (2)
	a sluggish dynamical response of the stratosphere to the latitudinal
	transport of angular momentum, induced by radiative heating and cooling.
	Mean vertical abundances of stratospheric orgs. and aerosols are
	detd. primarily by atm. chem. and condensation, whereas latitudinal
	distributions are more influenced by meridional circulations. In
	addn. to preferential scavenging by pptg. ice particles from above,
	the polar depletion of supersatd. methane results from periodic scavenging
	by short-lived tropospheric clouds, coupled with the steady poleward
	Mar. of the continuously drying atm. due to meridional transport.

	transition-state theory calculations were performed for the N(2D)
	reaction by using the results of ab initio molecular orbital calculations.
	It was suggested that correction of the "multiple surface coefficient"
	is necessary to interpret the measured rate constants. The ratio
	of the rate constant of N(2D) to that of N(2P) was found to be close
	to unity and was much smaller than those for the reactions with H2
	and CH4. The deactivation process of N(2P) was determined to be the
	spin-allowed quenching process, N(2P) + C2H4(S0) N(4S) + C2H4(T1).},

	these direct electron processes also a second dissociation channel
	is active: that by charge transfer followed by dissociative recombination.
	This latter route is the dominant one in the colder recombining phase
	of the plasma. Atomic and molecular radicals diffuse or flow to the
	surface, where new molecules are formed. As a result the original
	molecules are, after being dissociated in the plasma, converted at

	There is evidence that the molecular fragments resulting from dissociative
	recombination are ro-vibrationally (and possible electronically)
	excited. Also the molecules resulting from association at the surface
	may be ro-vibrationally or electronically excited. This may facilitate
	follow up processes as negative ion formation by dissociative attachment.
	These negative ions will be lost by mutual recombination with positive
	ions, giving again excited fragments. Rotational or other excitation

	conversion in a Radio Frequency dusty plasma experiment simulating
	the complex atmospheric reactivity on Titan. Analogues of Titan's
	aerosols have been produced in different N2-CH4 gas mixtures. Using
	in situ mass spectrometry, it has been found that, by varying the
	initial methane concentration, aerosols could be produced in methane
	steady state concentrations similar to Titan's atmospheric conditions.
	In our experiment, an initial ~5% methane concentration is necessary
	to ensure a ~1.5% methane steady state concentration in the plasma.
	The tholin mass production rate has been quantified as a function
	of the initial methane concentration. A maximum was found for a steady
	state CH4 concentration in agreement with Titan's atmospheric CH4
	concentrations. At this maximum, the tholin C/N ratio is about 1.45
	and the carbon gas to solid conversion yield is about 35%. We have
	modelled the mass production rate by a parabolic function, highlighting
	two competitive chemical regimes controlling the tholin production
	efficiency: an efficient growth process which is proportional to
	the methane consumption, and an inhibiting process which opposes
	the growth process and dominates it for initial methane concentrations
	higher than ~5%. To explain these two opposite effects, we propose
	two mechanisms: one involving HCN patterns in the tholins for the
	growth process, and one involving the increasing amount of atomic
	hydrogen in the plasma as well as the increase in aliphatic contributions
	in the tholins for the inhibiting process. This study highlights

	Titan tholin formed from N2 and CH4 gas mixtures at various surface-temperatures
	of the tholin ranging from 160 to 310 K. The combined analyses of
	the gas species and the exposed tholin indicate that the interaction
	mechanisms of atomic deuterium with the tholin are composed of three
	reactions; (a) abstraction of hydrogen from tholin resulting in gaseous
	HD formation (HD recombination), (b) addition of D atom into tholin
	(hydrogenation), and (c) removal of carbon and/or nitrogen (chemical
	erosion). The reaction probabilities of HD recombination and hydrogenation
	are obtained as [eta]abst=1.9(±0.6)×10-3×exp(-300/T) and [eta]hydro=2.08(±0.64)×exp(-1000/T),
	respectively. The chemical erosion process is very inefficient under
	the conditions of temperature range of Titan's stratosphere and mesosphere.
	Under Titan conditions, the rates of hydrogenation > HD recombination
	>> chemical erosion. Our measured HD recombination rate is about
	10 times (with an uncertainty of a factor of 3-5) the prediction

	can remove atomic hydrogen efficiently from Titan's atmosphere through

	that the heterogeneous reactions on the aerosol surface may predominantly
	remove atomic hydrogen in Titan's stratosphere and mesosphere. The
	results of our calculation also indicate that a low concentration
	of atomic hydrogen enhances the concentrations of unsaturated complex
	organics, such as C4H2 and phenyl radical, by more than two orders
	in magnitude around 400 km in altitude. Such an increase in unsaturated

	ease the computational load in the second stage recourse function
	calculation. The reweighting idea has previously been successfully

	study problems, including a blending problem relevant to the process
	industry and a large scale, novel sensor placement problem for water

	both refer to vibrationally (and electronically) excited states of
	HCN+ and HNC+, exhibit differences in the magnitudes of the cross

  abstract = {We review recent advances in the study of the dissociative recombination
	of molecular ions with electrons with a primary emphasis on experimental
	studies. In particular, we focus on previous experimental measurements
	of recombination rates for N$_2^+$, O$_2^+$, and NO$^+$ ions. In
	the context of this review, we present temperature dependent rate
	coefficients from recent merged beam studies of the dissociative
	recombination of N$_2^+$, O$_2^+$, and NO$^+$ ions with electrons.
	Identifying underlying physical differences between the various experimental
	techniques enables a discussion of the effects of vibrational excitation
	on the dissociative recombination of these major ionospheric species
	of ions. For T < 1200 K, we conclude that the recombination rates
	for N$_2^+$, O$_2^+$, and NO$^+$ ions in the ground electronic and
	vibrational states respectively are 2.2 $\times$ $10^{-7}$ (Te/300)$^{-0.39}$

	and (3.5 $\pm$ 0.5) $\times$ $10^{-7}$ (Te/300)/^{-0.69}$ cm$^3$s$^{-1}$.
	Vibrational excitation is shown to play a significant role in laboratory
	measurements of these recombination rates. For each of these species,
	vibrationally excited ions yielded a lower recombination rate than
	the ground state. We also discuss the recombination of these species
	of ions for T > 1200 K.},

  abstract = {Log-normal linear models are widely used in applications, and many
	times it is of interest to predict the response variable or to estimate
	the mean of the response variable at the original scale for a new
	set of covariate values. In this paper we consider the problem of
	efficient estimation of the conditional mean of the response variable
	at the original scale for log-normal linear models. Several existing
	estimators are reviewed first, including the maximum likelihood (ML)
	estimator, the restricted ML (REML) estimator, the uniformly minimum
	variance unbiased (UMVU) estimator, and a bias-corrected REML estimator.
	We then propose two estimators that minimize the asymptotic mean
	squared error and the asymptotic bias, respectively. A parametric
	bootstrap procedure is also described to obtain confidence intervals
	for the proposed estimators. Both the new estimators and the bootstrap
	procedure are very easy to implement. Comparisons of the estimators
	using simulation studies suggest that our estimators perform better
	than the existing ones, and the bootstrap procedure yields confidence
	intervals with good coverage properties. A real application of estimating
	the mean sediment discharge is used to illustrate the methodology.},

  abstract = {Discovery by Cassini's plasma instrument of heavy positive and negative
	ions within Titan's upper atmosphere and ionosphere has advanced
	our understanding of ion neutral chemistry within Titan's upper atmosphere,
	primarily composed of molecular nitrogen, with ~2.5% methane. The
	external energy flux transforms Titan's upper atmosphere and ionosphere
	into a medium rich in complex hydrocarbons, nitriles and haze particles
	extending from the surface to 1200 km altitudes. The energy sources
	are solar UV, solar X-rays, Saturn's magnetospheric ions and electrons,
	solar wind and shocked magnetosheath ions and electrons, galactic
	cosmic rays (GCR) and the ablation of incident meteoritic dust from
	Enceladus' E-ring and interplanetary medium. Here it is proposed
	that the heavy atmospheric ions detected in situ by Cassini for heights
	>950 km, are the likely seed particles for aerosols detected by the
	Huygens probe for altitudes <100 km. These seed particles may be
	in the form of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) containing
	both carbon and hydrogen atoms CnHx. There could also be hollow shells
	of carbon atoms, such as C60, called fullerenes which contain no
	hydrogen. The fullerenes may compose a significant fraction of the
	seed particles with PAHs contributing the rest. As shown by Cassini,
	the upper atmosphere is bombarded by magnetospheric plasma composed
	of protons, H2+ and water group ions. The latter provide keV oxygen,
	hydroxyl and water ions to Titan's upper atmosphere and can become
	trapped within the fullerene molecules and ions. Pickup keV N2+,
	N+ and CH4+ can also be implanted inside of fullerenes. Attachment
	of oxygen ions to PAH molecules is uncertain, but following thermalization
	O+ can interact with abundant CH4 contributing to the CO and CO2
	observed in Titan's atmosphere. If an exogenic keV O+ ion is implanted
	into the haze particles, it could become free oxygen within those
	aerosols that eventually fall onto Titan's surface. The process of
	freeing oxygen within aerosols could be driven by cosmic ray interactions
	with aerosols at all heights. This process could drive pre-biotic
	chemistry within the descending aerosols. Cosmic ray interactions
	with grains at the surface, including water frost depositing on grains
	from cryovolcanism, would further add to abundance of trapped free
	oxygen. Pre-biotic chemistry could arise within surface microcosms
	of the composite organic-ice grains, in part driven by free oxygen
	in the presence of organics and any heat sources, thereby raising
	the astrobiological potential for microscopic equivalents of Darwin's
	"warm ponds" on Titan.},

	factor of ten greater than our previous FALP determination [less-than-or-equals,
	slant]2×10-8 cm3 s-1, we have made a further detailed study of this
	very important interstellar recombination reaction using our improved
	FALP apparatus. Thus we have shown that [alpha](H3+(v[greater-or-equal,
	slanted]3)) ions do indeed recombine quite efficiently, a mean recombination
	coefficient at 300 K being [approximate]1.3×10-7 cm3 s-1, but that
	vibrationally-relaxed ions recombine much more slowly, [alpha](H3+(v=1,0))
	being [approximate]3×10-8 cm3 s-1 and [alpha](H3+ (v=0)) being somewhat
	smaller at (1-2)×10-8 cm3 s-1 at 300 K. Measurements at 210 and 140
	K indicated a slow increase of [alpha](H3+) with decreasing temperature,
	the increase being less than a factor of 2 for both [alpha](H3+(v[greater-or-equal,
	slanted]3)) and [alpha](H3+(v=1,0)) between 300 and 140 K. Values
	of [alpha](D3+) were also obtained at 300 K only. The values obtained
	for both the rapidly-recombining and the slowly-recombining D3+ ions
	were somewhat smaller than the corresponding values for H3+. In addition
	to these studies, we have also re-measured the [alpha] values at
	both 300 and 100 K for HCO+, N2H+ and CH5+ which are also important
	interstellar ions. The values obtained are in reasonable agreement
	with our previous FALP measurements, but our [alpha](HCO+) and [alpha](N2H+)
	are lower by factors of 2 and 3 respectively than the recent measurements
	made in a pulsed afterglow experiment.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we show that a wide variety of common soil bacteria
	are able to obtain their carbon and energy needs from tholin (a class
	of complex organic heteropolymers thought to be widely distributed
	through the solar system; in this case tholin was produced by passage
	of electrical discharge through a mixture of methane, ammonia, and
	water vapor). We have isolated aerobic, anaerobic, and facultatively
	anaerobic bacteria which are able to use tholin as a sole carbon
	source. Organisms which metabolize tholin represent a variety of
	bacterial genera including Clostridium, Pseudomonas, Bacillus, Acinetobacter,
	Paracoccus, Alcaligenes, Micrococcus, Corynebacterium, Aerobacter,
	Arthrobacter, Flavobacterium, and Actinomyces. Aerobic tholin-using
	bacteria were first isolated from soils containing unusual or sparse
	carbon sources. Some of these organisms were found to be facultatively
	anaerobic. Strictly anaerobic tholin-using bacteria were isolated
	from both carbon-rich and carbon-poor anaerobic lake muds. In addition,
	both aerobic and anaerobic tholin-using bacteria were isolated from
	common soil collected outside the laboratory building. Some, but
	not all, of the strains that were able to obtain carbon from tholin
	were also able to obtain their nitrogen requirements from tholin.
	Bacteria isolated from common soils were tested for their ability
	to obtain carbon from the water-soluble fraction, the ethanol-soluble
	fraction, and the water/ethanol-insoluble fraction of the tholin.
	Of the 3.5 x 10(7) bacteria isolated per gram of common soils, 1.7,
	0.5, and 0.2%, respectively, were able to obtain their carbon requirements
	from the water-soluble fraction, the ethanol-soluble fraction and
	the water/ethanol-insoluble fraction of the tholin. The palatability
	of tholins to modern microbes may have implications for the early
	evolution of microbial life on Earth. Tholins may have formed the
	base of the food chain for an early heterotrophic biosphere before
	the evolution of autotrophy on the early Earth. Where tholins are
	present on other planets, they could possibly be metabolized by contaminant
	microorganisms transported to these bodies via spacecraft. Thus,
	the presence of tholins should be taken into account when evaluating
	the planetary quarantine requirements for probes to other planets.

	transducers sending and receiving acoustic pulses over an unobstructed
	path of 15 cm. An accurate timing circuit is measuring the time it
	takes to propagate over the distance. Measurements are made in both
	directions to eliminate the effect of a const. drift of the medium.
	The transducers were optimized to operate at low pressure (high altitude)
	and will operate from about 60 km down to the surface. They will
	also perform well in case of landing in a liq. The API-S unit is
	an acoustic sounder, sending short pulses at 15 kHz every second
	and listening for echoes in between. It will detect droplets in the
	atm. and for the last 100 m it will characterize the acoustic scattering
	properties of the surface below. It will also give an accurate value
	for the descend velocity during the last 100 m. In case of landing
	in a (liq.) lake/ocean it will measure the depth of the lake/ocean

	of sound will, together with knowledge on the temp., enable the mean

	be measured by complementary sensors inside the SSP Top Hat, near

	(ISM). Their reaction has been studied here in cryogenic matrices
	using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) absorption spectroscopy.
	The reaction produced a weakly bonded complex for which a C-C asymmetric
	stretch vibrational frequency in the C3 unit is shifted to lower
	energy (vs. uncomplexed C3) by 4.5 and 1.6 cm-1 in Ar and Kr matrices,
	respectively. The singlet potential surface of the C3 + C6H6 reaction
	was partially mapped using density functional theory (DFT) theory
	(B3LYP with 6-31G** and 6-311 + G**). Although thirteen stable products
	are predicted, only two agree satisfactorily with the observed small
	shift and the isotopomer frequencies of 13C-substituted C3 · C6H6
	complexes. Products formed by the rearrangement of the complex's
	components apparently have no (or very low) entrance barriers. Finally,
	a low energy reaction pathway has been computed for the production
	of a dehydrogenated PAH (with an indene framework) from the reaction
	of the complexed C3 and C6H6 moieties. Indene has been observed previously
	in the discharge reactions of benzene where C3 has also been produced.},

	and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry experiments of the Huygens
	probe arrived at Titan, systematic experimental studies were led
	to estimate the influence of the operating conditions on the analyses
	that should have been achieved in the Titan's atmosphere. The primary
	objective of this study was to estimate the influence of operating
	conditions variations induced by (i) instrumental modifications made
	shortly before the probe launch which can have changed the operating
	pressures; (ii) the change of the probe environmental conditions
	(pressure, temperature) during its descent in the atmosphere; (iii)
	a possible deviation of pressure and temperature regulations from
	their nominal values because of the long journey of the instrument
	in space, or of other external events. The secondary objective of
	this work was to create an analytical database that can be used as
	a reference to treat the chromatograms obtained in situ, and help
	to identify chromatographically the analyzed species, complementary
	to mass spectrometry. Beyond the application to a specific instrument,
	this work was also useful to experimentally estimate the fundamental
	evolution of the separation as a function of the changes of operating
	conditions with time. The obtained results show (i) the significant
	influence of inlet and outlet pressure variation on the time of analysis,
	but not on the separation power. It thus enables to significantly
	shorten the analysis duration, and thus to analyze more compounds
	within the fixed time of analysis of the instrument; (ii) the significant
	influence of temperature on the retention. In this frame, the enthalpies
	of exchange between the gas phase and the stationary phase of the
	species were determined to be used to retrieve the analyzed species
	in case of deviation of the operating temperature; (iii) that the
	possible aging of the columns does not have influence on the columns
	efficiency and separation power; (iv) the analytical capabilities
	of the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry experiment within operating
	conditions representative of those encountered in situ. Finally,
	in spite of possible operating condition changes, it is shown that
	results coming from the gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer experiment,

	to investigate elementary reaction kinetics and the chemistry of

	detection and the ease of tunability of synchrotron radiation make
	it possible to acquire full sets of data as a function of mass, photon
	energy, and of the physical dimension of the system, e.g. distance
	from the burner or time after reaction initiation. The data are in
	essence an indirect image of the chemistry. The data can be quantitatively
	correlated and integrated along any of several dimensions to compare
	to traditional measurements such as time or distance profiles of
	individual chemical species, but it can also be directly interpreted
	in image form. This perspective offers an overview of flame chemistry
	and chemical kinetics measurements that combine tunable photoionization
	with multiple-mass detection, emphasizing the overall insight that
	can be gained from multidimensional data on these systems. The low-pressure
	flame apparatus is capable of providing isomer-resolved mass spectra
	of stable and radical species as a function of position in the flame.
	The overall chemical structure of the flames can be readily seen
	from images of the evolving mass spectrum as distance from the burner
	increases, with isomer-specific information given in images of the
	photoionization efficiency. Several flames are compared in this manner,
	with a focus on identification of global differences in fuel-decomposition
	and soot-formation pathways. Differences in the chemistry of flames
	of isomeric fuels can be discerned. The application of multiplexed
	synchrotron photoionization to elementary reaction kinetics permits
	identification of time-resolved isomeric composition in reacting
	systems. The power of this technique is illustrated by the separation
	of direct and dissociative ionization signals in the reaction of
	C2H5 with O2; by the resolution of isomeric products in reactions
	of the ethynyl (C2H) radical; and by preliminary observation of branching
	to methyl + propargyl products in the self-reaction of vinyl radicals.
	Finally, prospects for future research using multiplexed photoionization

	peak at around 0.5-5 mbar for temperature and 0.1-10 mbar for the

	ratios of HCN, HC3N, and C2N2 show a marked increase in abundance
	towards the north, whereas C2H2 remains relatively constant. Variations

	wind speeds. For 90[degree sign]-20[degree sign] S the retrieved
	HCN abundance is fairly constant with a volume mixing ratio of around

	for the HCN and HC3N latitude variations can be explained by HC3N's
	much shorter photochemical lifetime, which prevents it from mixing
	with air at lower latitude. It is also consistent with a polar vortex
	which inhibits mixing of volatile rich air inside the vortex with
	that at lower latitudes. Only one observation was far enough north

	the methane ionization threshold at 12.6 eV, up to and beyond the

	Three gas mixtures of increasing complexity were used: N2/CH4 (0.96/0.04),
	N2/CH4/C2H2 (0.96/0.04/0.001), and N2/CH4/C2H2/C2H4 (0.96/0.04/0.001/0.001).
	The resulting ions were detected with a high-resolution (1 T) FT-ICR
	mass spectrometer as a function of time and VUV photon energy. In
	order to interpret the experimental results, a Titan ionospheric
	model was adapted to the laboratory conditions. This model had previously
	allowed the identification of the ions detected in the Titan upper
	atmosphere by the ion neutral mass spectrometer (INMS) onboard the
	Cassini spacecraft. Comparison between observed and modeled ion densities
	validates the kinetic model (reactions, rate constants, product branching
	ratios) for the primary steps of molecular growth. It also reveals
	differences that we attribute to an intense surface chemistry. This

  abstract = {The interaction of matter with its environment is the driving force
	behind the evolution of 99% of the observed matter in the universe.
	The majority of the visible universe exists in a state of weak ionization,
	the so called fourth state of matter: plasma. Plasmas are ubiquitous,
	from those occurring naturally; interstellar molecular clouds, cometary
	comae, circumstellar shells, to those which are anthropic in origin;
	flames, combustion engines and fusion reactors. The evolution of
	these plasmas is driven by the interaction of the plasma constituents,
	the ions, and the electrons. One of the most important subsets of
	these reactions is electron-molecular ion recombination. This process
	is significant for two very important reasons. It is an ionization
	reducing reaction, removing two ionised species and producing neutral
	products. Furthermore, these products may themselves be reactive
	radical species which can then further drive the evolution of the
	plasma. The rate at which the electron reacts with the ion depends
	on many parameters, for examples the collision energy, the internal
	energy of the ion, and the structure of the ion itself. Measuring
	these properties together with the manner in which the system breaks
	up is therefore critical if the evolution of the environment is to
	be understood at all. Several techniques have been developed to study
	just such reactions to obtain the necessary information on the parameters.
	In this paper the focus will be on one the most recently developed
	of these, the Ion Storage Ring, together with the detection tools
	and techniques used to extract the necessary information from the
	reaction. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., Mass Spec Rev 27: 485-530,

  abstract = {CH + 3 is an important molecular ion in the astrochemistry of diffuse
	clouds, dense clouds, cometary comae, and planetary ionospheres.
	However, the rate of one of the major destruction mechanisms of CH
	+ 3 , dissociative recombination (DR), has long been uncertain, hindering
	the use of CH + 3 as an astrochemical probe. Here, we present the
	first absolute measurement of the DR of vibrationally cold CH + 3
	, which has been made using the heavy storage ring CRYRING in Stockholm,
	Sweden. From our collision-energy-dependent cross sections, we infer
	a thermal rate constant of k ( T ) = 6.97(Â± 0.03) Ã 10 â7 ( T
	/300) â0.61(Â± 0.01)Â cm 3 s â1 over the region 10 K â¤ T â¤
	1000Â K. At low collision energies, we have measured the branching
	fractions of the DR products to be CH 3 (0.00 +0.01 â 0.00 ), CH
	2 + H (0.35 +0.01 â 0.01 ), CH + 2H (0.20 +0.02 â 0.02 ), CH
	+ H 2 (0.10 +0.01 â 0.01 ), and C + H 2 + H (0.35 +0.01 â 0.02
	), indicating that two or more C-H bonds are broken in 65% of all
	collisions. We also present vibrational calculations which indicate
	that the CH + 3 ions in the storage ring were relaxed to the vibrational
	ground state by spontaneous emission during the storage time. Finally,
	we discuss the implications of these new measurements for the observation
	of CH + 3 in regions of the diffuse interstellar medium where CH

	ongoing process of the generation of complex organics from the simplest
	hydrocarbon, methane. Solar radiation and magnetosphere electrons
	are the main energy sources that drive the reactions in Titan's atmosphere.
	Since energy from solar radiation is 200 times greater than that
	from magnetosphere electrons, we have investigated the products formed
	by the action of UV radiation (185 and 254 nm) on a mixture of gases
	containing nitrogen, methane, hydrogen, acetylene, ethylene, and
	cyanoacetylene, the basic gas mixture (BGM) that simulates aspects
	of Titan's atmosphere using a flow reactor [Tran, B.N., Ferris, J.P.,
	Chera, J.J., 2003a. Icarus 162, 114-124; Tran, B.N., Joseph, J.C.,
	Force, M., Briggs, R.G., Vuitton, V., Ferris, J.P., 2005. Icarus
	177, 106-115]. The present research extends these studies by the
	addition of carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide to the BGM. Quantum
	yields for the loss of reactants and the formation of volatile products
	were determined and compared with those measured in the absence of
	the hydrogen cyanide and carbon monoxide. The GCMS analyses of the
	volatile photolysis products from the BGM, with added hydrogen cyanide,
	had a composition similar to that of the BGM while the photolysis
	products of the BGM with added carbon monoxide contained many oxygenated
	compounds. The infrared spectrum of the corresponding solid product
	revealed the absorption band of a ketone group, which was probably
	formed from the reaction of carbon monoxide with the free radicals
	generated by photolysis of acetylene and ethylene. Of particular
	interest was the observation that the addition of HCN to the gas
	mixture only resulted in a very small change in the C/N ratio and
	in the intensity of the CN frequency at 2210 cm-1 in the infrared
	spectrum suggesting that little HCN is incorporated into the haze
	analog. The C/N ratio of the haze analogs was found to be in the
	10-12 range. The UV spectra of the solid products formed when HCN
	or CO added to the BGM is similar to the UV absorption formed from
	the BGM alone. This result is consistent with absence of additional
	UV chromophores to the solid product when these mixtures are photolyzed.
	The following photoproducts, which were not starting materials in
	our photochemical studies, have been observed on Titan: acetonitrile,
	benzene, diacetylene, ethane, propene, propane, and propyne.},

	ions can be represented within the same framework as unimolecular
	reactions of neutral molecules. However{,} because of different intra-
	and intermolecular interaction potentials{,} some differences between
	ionic and neutral systems should also be expected. Starting from
	these generalities{,} the present article analyzes the temperature
	and pressure dependences of dissociation/association rates of ion-molecule
	reaction systems. The reaction N + N (+ M) [Leftrightarrow] N (+
	M) is considered in particular and falloff curves for this reaction
	are constructed over the temperature range 5-600 K. Falloff corrections
	are applied to earlier experiments which allows for a representation
	of the rate coefficients in terms of a limiting low-pressure rate

	for a 10 base-pair DNA oligomer, and for the 108-residue protein
	thioredoxin. A slight modification of our earlier suggested parameters
	makes the GB results more like those found in explicit solvent, primarily
	by slightly increasing the strength of NH&bond;O and NH&bond;N internal

	with a rectangular probability distribution, and to analyze random
	errors, the perturbation is carried out randomly with normal probability
	distributions. Thermodynamic parameters are obtained from appropriate
	regression methods and used to simulate a given unit operation and
	to obtain cumulative frequency distributions, providing a quantitative
	risk assessment and a better understanding of the role of uncertainty
	in process design and simulation. The results show that the proposed

	of the environmental performance is demonstrated with a chemical
	process to recover toluene and ethyl acetate by absorption from a
	gaseous waste stream of a cellophane production plant. In this case
	study, the environmental performance is defined as the estimation
	of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and total emissions of the
	plant and of several environmental risk indexes. We found that estimations
	of VOCs are very sensitive to uncertainty in thermophysical properties
	such as infinite-dilution activity coefficients, and vapor pressures
	(through uncertain temperature variations). Additionally, we concluded
	that calculation of the total emissions can be very sensitive to
	fuel content factors such as those used to estimate greenhouse gases.
	This can have such an impact on the emission calculations that a
	detailed model of the given chemical process might not be required
	for the estimation of the total emissions. In other words, a simpler
	process flowsheet model can perform the same task just as well, with
	the results within the variations caused by uncertainty in the thermophysical
	properties. We demonstrate a Monte Carlo approach that allows the
	detection of such uncertainty characteristics in a design, providing
	a rational basis for prediction of the associated environmental risks.
	This procedure also enables the deconvolution of various sources
	of uncertainty, and the estimation of physical property uncertainty
	through a similarity approach. We concluded that our framework can

  abstract = {Abstract: In this work, we study the robustness of nonlinear regression
	methods under uncertainty for parameter estimation for chemical kinetics
	models. We used Monte Carlo simulation to study the influence of
	two main types of uncertainty, namely, random errors and incomplete
	experimental data sets. The regression methods analyzed were least-squares
	minimization (LSM), maximum likelihood (ML), and a method that automatically
	reweights the objective function during the course of the optimization
	called IVEM (inside-variance estimation method). Although this work
	represents a preliminary attempt toward understanding the effects
	of uncertainty in nonlinear regression, the results from the analysis
	of the case studies indicate that the performance of the regression
	procedures can be highly sensitive to uncertainty due to random errors
	and incomplete data sets. The results also suggest that traditional
	methods of assigning weights a priori to regression functions can
	affect the performance of the regression unless these weights correspond
	to a careful characterization of the residual statistics of the regression
	problem. In the case in which there is no prior knowledge of these
	weights (particularly in maximum likelihood regression), we suggest
	that they be characterized, in a preliminary way, by performing a
	least-squares minimization regression first or by using a method
	that automatically estimates these weights during the course of the
	regression (IVEM). We believe that the performance of regression
	techniques under uncertainty requires attention before a regression
	method is chosen or the parameters obtained are deemed valid.},

	CH3O+, and H2O+ products are seen for the first time, and the H3O+
	product is much more intense in comparison with experiments on vibrationally
	cold CH4. The previously observed products CH3+ and CH4+ are comparable

	temperature profiles in Titan's atmosphere. We analyzed two sets
	of spectra, one at 15[degree sign] S (Tb flyby) and the other one
	at 80[degree sign] N (T3 flyby). The spectral range 600-1400 cm-1,
	recorded at a resolution of 0.5 cm-1, was used to determine molecular
	abundances and temperatures in the stratosphere in the altitude range
	100-460 km for Tb and 170-495 km for T3. Both temperature profiles
	show a well defined stratopause, at around 310 km (0.07 mbar) and
	183 K at 13[degree sign] S, and 380 km (0.01 mbar) with 207 K at
	80[degree sign] N. Near the north pole, stratospheric temperatures
	are colder and mesospheric temperatures are warmer than near the
	equator. C2H2, C2H6, C3H8 and HCN display vertical mixing ratio profiles
	that increase with height at 15[degree sign] S and 80[degree sign]
	N, consistent with their formation in the upper atmosphere, diffusion
	downwards and condensation in the lower stratosphere, as expected
	from photochemical models. The CH3C2H and C4H2 mixing ratios also
	increase with height at 15[degree sign] S. But near the north pole,
	their profiles present an unexpected minimum around 300 km, observed
	for the first time thanks to the high vertical resolution of the
	CIRS limb data. C2H4 is the only molecule having a vertical abundance
	profile that decreases with height at 15[degree sign] S. At 80[degree
	sign] N, it also displays a minimum of its mixing ratio around the
	0.1-mbar level. For C6H6, an upper limit of 1.1 ppb (in the 0.3-10
	mbar range) is derived at 15[degree sign] S, whereas a constant mixing
	ratio profile of is inferred near the north pole. At 15[degree sign]
	S, the vertical profile of HCN exhibits a steeper gradient than other
	molecules, which suggests that a sink for this molecule exists in
	the stratosphere, possibly due to haze formation. All molecules display
	a more or less pronounced enrichment towards the north pole, probably
	due, in part, to subsidence of air at the north (winter) pole that
	brings air enriched in photochemical compounds from the upper atmosphere
	to lower levels.},

	able to reproduce the full set of stratospheric molecular mixing
	ratios inferred from observations. In order to assess how well reaction
	sets describe hydrocarbon chemistry, theoretical modeling predictions
	were compared to the results of a laboratory experiment. A CH4-C2H2
	mixture was irradiated at 185 nm in an atmospheric simulation chamber
	and the evolution of the gas mixture was followed in situ and in
	real time by infrared spectroscopy. In parallel, a 0D theoretical
	model of the laboratory experiment was developed. A new reaction
	set describing Titan's chemistry was built and incorporated in the
	model. Lebonnois et al. [Lebonnois, S., Toublanc, D., Hourdin, F.,
	Rannou, P., 2001. Icarus 152, 384-406] reaction set was also used
	for comparison. The presence of small amounts of atmospheric O2 in
	the experiment was properly accounted for and led us to suggest that
	oxygenated chemistry might be a source of C2H4 in Titan's atmosphere.
	With Lebonnois et al. [Lebonnois, S., Toublanc, D., Hourdin, F.,
	Rannou, P., 2001. Icarus 152, 384-406] reaction set, the model could
	not fit at all the experimental evolution of the compounds. This
	is explained by some of the choices made for crucial kinetic parameters
	such as the quantum yield of photolysis of C2H2. Also, the absence
	of some reactions led to the enhancement of pathways that would otherwise
	be negligible. For example, the lack of reactions between C4H4 and
	radicals induced an erroneously high photolysis rate for this species.
	With the reaction set built in this study, the model much better
	fits the experiment, especially when the {soot,} which includes C4H4,
	is recycled into C2H2. This shows that photochemistry of the larger
	species has a role in determining the lighter species concentrations
	and that considering that they are simply lost from the system is
	not a valid assumption. Including even an abridged set of C4 + hydrocarbon
	reactions will be required in future photochemical models. Especially,
	photolysis rates and yields for C2H2, C4H2, and C4H4, are important
	parameters in need of a better determination.},

	can be explained by recombination of phenyl radicals (C6H5) with
	H atoms on the walls of the instrument and that the measured signal
	is a combination of (1) C6H6 from the atmosphere and (2) C6H6 formed
	within the instrument. In parallel, we investigate Titan benzene

	predicts that the globally averaged production rate of benzene by

	This result is consistent with the phenyl/benzene ratio required

	through reaction of phenyl with other radicals, leading to the formation

	molecular organic species. This study is based on measurements by
	five instruments (RPWS/LP, RPWS/E, INMS, CAPS/ELS, CAPS/IBS) onboard
	the Cassini spacecraft during three flybys (T17, T18, T32) of Titan.
	The ionospheric peaks encountered at altitudes of 950-1300 km had
	densities in the range 900-3000 cm-3. Below these peaks the number
	densities of heavy positively charged ions reached 100-2000 cm-3
	and approached 50-70% of the total ionospheric density with an increasing
	trend toward lowest measured altitudes. Simultaneously measured negatively
	charged ion densities were in the range 50-150 cm-3. These results
	imply that ~105-106 heavy positively charged ions/m3/s are continuously
	recombining into heavy neutrals and supply the atmosphere of Titan.
	The ionosphere may in this way produce 0.1-1 Mt/yr of heavy organic
	compounds and is therefore a sizable source for aerosol formation.
	We also predict that Titan's ionosphere is dominated by heavy (>100 amu)
	molecular ions below 950 km.},

  abstract = {Measurements with the Cassini Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer (INMS)
	and two Cassini Plasma Spectrometer (CAPS) sensors, the Ion beam
	Spectrometer (IBS) and the Electron Spectrometer (ELS), have revealed
	the presence of a significant population of heavy hydrocarbon and
	nitrile species well above the homopause, with masses as large as
	several thousand Daltons (Da). The INMS ion and neutral spectra cover
	the mass range 1â100 Da. The IBS has measured positive ions up
	to 350 Da, while the ELS has detected concentrations of negative
	ions as high as 20% of the total negatively charged ionosphere component
	extending to over 13,000 Da. These measurements have motivated the
	development of new atmospheric models and have significant implications
	for our knowledge and understanding of Titan's haze layers.
	
	
	 The existence of a thick haze obscuring Titan's surface was inferred
	from remote-sensing observations at infrared and ultraviolet
	
	 wavelengths during the mid-1970s (Danielson et al. 1973; Veverka
	1973; Zellner 1973; Trafton 1975) and confirmed by Voyager 1 and
	2 imaging, which revealed the existence of two principal haze layers,
	a main layer and a
	
	 thin detached layer ~100 km above it, both merging at high northern
	latitudes (Smith et al. 1981, 1982). It was recognized early on (e.g.,
	Danielson et al. 1973) that photochemistry occurring in the upper
	atmosphere of Titan was the likely source of the haze-forming aerosols,
	and in
	
	 the years leading up to the Voyager encounters several laboratory
	experiments were performed in an attempt to synthesize materials
	
	 whose properties were similar to those of the postulated hazes (see
	reviews by Chang et al. 1979 and Cabane and Chassefière 1995). Substances
	investigated as possible candidates for the haze-forming aerosols
	included polymers of acetylene, ethylene,
	
	 and HCN (Scattergood and Owen 1977; Podolak and Bar-Nun 1979) and
	“tholins,” complex organic solids, brownish in color, produced in
	a simulated reducing planetary atmosphere through
	
	 UV irradiation and electric discharge (Khare and Sagan 1973; Sagan
	and Khare 1979).
	
	
	 Prior to the Voyager encounters, the only species known with certainty
	to be present in Titan's atmosphere were CH4 and C2H6, although there
	was evidence for the presence of C2H2 and C2H4 as well (Gillett 1975).
	The presence of N2, predicted by Hunten (1977) and Atreya et al.
	(1978), had not yet been established, although Titan's reddish-brown
	albedo suggested that nitrogen-bearing species (and/or sulfur-bearing
	
	 ones) should be present in the haze aerosols (Scattergood and Owen
	1977; Chang et al. 1979). The Voyagers revealed that Titan's atmosphere
	consists predominantly (&gt;90%) of molecular nitrogen (Broadfoot
	et al. 1981; Tyler et al. 1981) with methane as the next most abundant
	species and provided positive identifications of several hydrocarbons
	including C2H2, C2H4, and C3H8 as well as of the nitriles HCN, HC3N,
	and C2N2 (Hanel et al. 1981, 1982; Kunde et al. 1981; Maguire et
	al. 1981).
	
	
	 During the interval between the Voyager encounters and the arrival
	of Cassini in the Saturn system, several photochemical
	
	 models were developed to describe the production of hydrocarbons
	and nitriles resulting from the dissociation of N2 and CH4 in Titan's
	upper atmosphere by electron impact (N2) and UV irradiation (CH4)
	(e.g., Yung et al. 1984; Toublanc et al. 1995; Wilson and Atreya
	2004). More a number of laboratory, modeling, and theoretical studies
	were undertaken to investigate the formation of the haze
	
	 layers and the physical, optical, and chemical properties of the
	aerosols in light of both the Voyager data and new remote-sensing
	
	 observations (see reviews by Cabane and Chassefière 1995 and McKay
	et al. 2001). Post-Voyager experiments to synthesize aerosol analogs
	in the laboratory involved both the production of tholins in a simulated
	
	 Titan N2-CH4 atmosphere (e.g., Thompson et al. 1994; Coll et al.
	1999) and the creation of the photopolymers of C2H2, C2H4, and HCN
	(Bar-Nun et al. 1988; Scattergood et al. 1992) as well as of HC3N
	and HC3N/C2H2 (Clarke and Ferris 1997). The spectral and optical
	properties of tholins were found to be consistent with Titan's albedo
	and with the refractive
	
	 properties of Titan's haze particles, suggesting that tholins are
	good analogs for Titan's aerosols (Khare et al. 1984).
	
	
	 The ultimate sources of Titan's aerosols are the gas-phase dissociation
	products of CH4 and N2. However, as noted by Lebonnois et al. (2002),
	the transition from gas-phase compounds to solid-phase aerosols is
	poorly understood. They suggested three possible chemical
	
	 pathways that could polymerize simple molecules to macromolecules,
	which are the presumed precursors to aerosol particles,
	
	 producing: (1) polymers of acetylene and cyanoacetylene, (2) polycyclic
	aromatics, and (3) polymers of HCN and other nitriles,
	
	 and polyynes. Their model suggested a total production rate of 4
	× 10−14 g cm−2 s−1 and a C/N ratio of 4, in a production zone slightly
	lower than 200 km altitude. Wilson and Atreya (2003) considered similar
	pathways and concluded that the growth of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
	(PAH) throughout the lower
	
	 stratosphere could play an important role in haze formation. They
	suggested that the peak chemical production of haze would
	
	 lie near 220 km, with a column integrated production rate of 3.2
	× 10−14 g cm−2 s−1. Wilson and Atreya (2003) pointed out that the
	discovery of benzene in Titan's atmosphere by ISO (Coustenis et al.
	2003) favored the PAH pathway. Trainer et al. (2004) found that for
	particles produced from a mixture of 10% CH4 in N2 the results were
	consistent with a large fraction of aromatics, including specific
	mass spectral peaks likely due to PAHs.
	
	 However, at lower concentrations of CH4 (1% and lower), the mass
	fraction of PAHs greatly diminished, and an aliphatic pathway dominated.
	
	
	 Laboratory simulations also indicate a possible key role for PAHs.
	Khare et al. (2002) reported on an analysis of the time-dependent
	chemical evolution of gas phase products in a Titan simulation. They
	found
	
	 an early dominance of aromatic ring structures that led in the later
	stages of the experiment to the appearance of nitrile
	
	 and amine compounds. Thompson et al. (1991) reported the yields of
	gaseous hydrocarbons and nitriles produced at pressures (1,700 Pa
	and 24 Pa) in a continuous-flow,
	
	 low-dose, cold plasma discharge excited in an atmosphere consisting
	of 10% CH4 and 90% N2 at 295 K. At 1,700 Pa, 59 gaseous species including
	27 nitriles were detected while at 24 Pa, 19 species are detected,
	including
	
	 six nitriles and three other unidentified N-bearing compounds. The
	types of molecules formed changed even more markedly, with
	
	 high degrees of multiple bonding at 24 Pa prevailing over more H-saturated
	molecules at 1,700 Pa. Imanaka et al. (2004) conducted a series of
	experiments from high (2,300 Pa) to low (13 Pa) pressure. They found
	an increase in the aromatic compounds
	
	 and a decrease in C/N ratio in tholins formed at low pressures, indicating
	the presence of the nitrogen-containing polycyclic
	
	 aromatic compounds in tholins formed at low pressures. They concluded
	that the haze layers at various altitudes might have
	
	 different chemical and optical properties, but most importantly they
	found that there is a fundamental change in the nature
	
	 of haze production between pressures above and below roughly 100
	Pa.},

	The combination of measurements for the photofragment kinetic energy

	this complicated multichannel dissociation process are proposed.
	In particular, two distinct dissociation pathways are elucidated

	pathway invokes a perpendicular-type transition in absorption, which
	subsequently undergoes intersystem crossing to the triplet surface
	and then dissociates. The fragmentation via this route yields fast
	CH3 +H with a negative beta parameter. Alternatively, a parallel-type
	excitation is involved, followed by internal conversion to the ground-state
	surface on which dissociation occurs. This pathway results in less
	kinetic energy release and yields a positive beta parameter. An intriguing

  abstract = {Risk and policy analysis involves consideration of uncertainties.
	A quantitative probabilistic method for uncertainty analysis includes:
	(1) quantifying and assigning probabilistic distributions to the
	input uncertainties, (2) sampling the distributions of these uncertain
	parameters in an iterative fashion using Monte Carlo methods, (3)
	propagating the effects of uncertainties through the model, and (4)
	predicting the outcomes in terms of probabilistic measures like mean,
	variance, and fractiles. However, the results of the probabilistic
	analysis depend on the number of samples chosen. The sample size
	required for a particular analysis depends on various factors such
	as type of model, the random number generator used, type of distributions,
	and the output probabilistic measure and cannot be universally defined.
	The general tendency is to reduce the samples as much as possible
	without realizing the effect on decisions. For example, the mean
	of the output requires a number of samples that is an order of magnitude
	less compared to the variance. Therefore, it is desirable to use
	a sampling technique that can predict the output probabilistic measure
	accurately with the minimum number of samples. In this work, we present
	new sampling techniques based on Quasi-Monte Carlo sequences and

	the ices of H2O, NH3, CO2, and CH4 is important in theories concerning
	the genesis and evolution of the solar system. In this study lifetimes
	of small, orbiting ice bodies are considered as a function of their
	initial sizes, chem. compns., and heliocentric or planetocentric
	distances. The surface temps. to which this work applies are considerably
	less than the m. ps. Thus, for small heliocentric distances and for
	short-period cometary orbits, the surface temp. and hence the rate
	of mass-loss by evapn. is detd. by balancing the energy received
	against the energy removed from the surface by ablation, by radiative
	cooling, and by inward heat flow. The results of the calcn. of surface
	temps. for the 4 ices as a function of heliocentric distance are
	given in graphical form. The derived evaporative lifetimes as a function
	of initial radii show that H2O ice is the most stable, followed in
	order by NH3, CO2, and CH4. A tabulation of the stability of H2O
	ice for the various planetary and cometary orbits shows that, over
	this range, the life of a 1-km. sphere varies from <0.1 for certain
	cometary orbits to >1015 million yrs. at the Saturn distance. For
	quite large distances, i.e., >10 times the earth's distance for most
	ices and possibly 3 times the earth's distance for H2O ice, the Poynting-Robertson
	effect must also be considered; indeed, it is found that this then
	becomes decisive in detg. the lifetimes of the several ices. H2O
	ice is the only one which could be stable on a satellite of Jupiter,
	NH3 and CO2 could also be stable on a satellite of Saturn (excluding
	Titan, to which this theory is not applicable), and only H2O and,

  abstract = {The photodissociation of methane at Lyman &#945; (1216 �) has been
	the focus of much scrutiny over the past few years. Methane photolysis
	leads to the formation of H2 molecules as well as H, CH, 1CH2, 3CH2,
	and CH3 radicals, which promote the propagation of hydrocarbon chemistry.
	However, recent studies [Mordaunt et al., 1993; Romani, 1996; Smith
	and Raulin, 1999] have not fully resolved the issue of methane photolytic
	product yields at this wavelength. We use a one-dimensional photochemical
	model with updated chemistry to investigate the significance of these
	quantum yield schemes on the hydrocarbon chemistry of Titan's atmosphere,
	where Lyman &#945; radiation accounts for 75% of methane photolysis
	longward of 1000 �. Sensitivity studies show that while simple hydrocarbons
	like C2H2 (acetylene) and C2H4 (ethylene), which serve as important
	intermediates to the formation of more complex hydrocarbons, show
	virtually no variation in abundance, minor C3 molecules do show substantial
	sensitivity to choice of quantum yield scheme. We find that the C3H4
	isomers (methylacetylene, aliene) and C3H6 (propylene) display major
	variation in atmospheric mixing ratios under the implementation of
	these schemes, with a maximum variation of approximately a factor
	of 5 in C3H4 abundance and approximately a factor of 4 for C3H6.
	In these cases our nominal scheme, recommended by Romani [1996],
	offers an intermediate result in comparison with the other schemes.
	We also find that choice of pathway for non-Lyman &#945; methane
	absorption does affect hydrocarbon chemistry in the atmosphere of
	Titan, but this effect is minimal. A 65% variation in C2H6 (ethane)
	abundance, a value within observational uncertainty, is the largest
	divergence found for a wide range of possible non-Lyman &#945; photofragment
	quantum yields. These results will have significance in future modeling
	and interpretation of observations of the atmosphere of Titan.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a Monte Carlo uncertainty/variability analysis
	applied to assessment of salmonid embryo survival affected by the
	deposition of fine sand in the spawning gravel riverbed. For the
	system being modeled, the uncertainty originates from the lack of
	perfect knowledge about the spawning habitat, while the variability
	arises from the natural diversity in the amount of sand deposit.
	A second-order Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) procedure consisting
	of multiple realizations of model parameters and full-range iterations
	of input variable is used to separately propagate the knowledge uncertainty
	and natural variability of the system. Given that the three parameters
	of the present model are highly correlated (correlation coefficients
	>0.8), we use four multivariate methods (Iman-Conover method, standard
	normal transformation method, normal copula method, and maximum-entropy
	copula method) to generate correlated model parameters. The scatter
	plots of the correlated parameters generated with various methods
	demonstrate different correlation patterns. An important finding
	of the present uncertainty/variability analyses and risk assessments
	is that the outcomes resulting from the four correlated scenarios
	are very similar, regardless of the diverse correlation patterns.
	The output of the second-order MCS is a collection of cause-effect
	relations (spaghetti plot) that can facilitate the analyses of survival-rate
	uncertainty/variability. The favorable habitat conditions are also
	defined on the basis of the spaghetti plot. It is revealed that significant
	values of information are associated with the parameter correlations,
	especially when higher levels of embryo survival are targeted. The
	results further indicate that the outcomes of the independent (less
	realistic) scenario substantially differ from those of the correlated
	ones, indicating that the effect of parameter correlations should
	be incorporated into the MCS whenever possible. This work provides
	a useful paradigm for the systematic uncertainty/variability analyses
	in the context of ecological risk assessments.},

	vertical mixing rate, and escape flux from the upper atmosphere.
	The mean atmospheric temperature in the region sampled by the INMS
	is 149±3 K, where the variance is a consequence of local time variations
	in temperature. The CH4 mole fraction at 1174 km is 2.71±0.1%. The
	effects of diffusive separation are clearly seen in the data that
	we interpret as an eddy diffusion coefficient of , that, along with
	the measured CH4 mole fraction, implies a mole fraction in the stratosphere
	of 2.2±0.2%. The H2 distribution is affected primarily by upward
	flow and atmospheric escape. The H2 mole fraction at 1200 km is 4±1×10-3
	and analysis of the altitude profile indicates an upward flux of
	, referred to the surface. If horizontal variations in temperature
	and H2 density are small, this upward flux also represents the escape
	flux from the atmosphere. The CH4 density exhibits significant horizontal
	variations that are likely an indication of dynamical processes in
	the upper atmosphere.},

  abstract = {The Cassini Plasma Spectrometer (CAPS) will make comprehensive three-dimensional
	mass-resolved measurements of the full variety of plasma phenomena
	found in Saturn&#146;s magnetosphere. Our fundamental scientific
	goals are to understand the nature of saturnian plasmas primarily
	their sources of ionization, and the means by which they are accelerated,
	transported, and lost. In so doing the CAPS investigation will contribute
	to understanding Saturn&#146;s magnetosphere and its complex interactions
	with Titan, the icy satellites and rings, Saturn&#146;s ionosphere
	and aurora, and the solar wind. Our design approach meets these goals
	by emphasizing two complementary types of measurements: high-time
	resolution velocity distributions of electrons and all major ion
	species; and lower-time resolution, high-mass resolution spectra
	of all ion species. The CAPS instrument is made up of three sensors:
	the Electron Spectrometer (ELS), the Ion Beam Spectrometer (IBS),
	and the Ion Mass Spectrometer (IMS). The ELS measures the velocity
	distribution of electrons from 0.6 eV to 28,250 keV, a range that
	permits coverage of thermal electrons found at Titan and near the
	ring plane as well as more energetic trapped electrons and auroral
	particles. The IBS measures ion velocity distributions with very
	high angular and energy resolution from 1 eV to 49,800 keV. It is
	specially designed to measure sharply defined ion beams expected
	in the solar wind at 9.5 AU, highly directional rammed ion fluxes
	encountered in Titan&#146;s ionosphere, and anticipated field-aligned
	auroral fluxes. The IMS is designed to measure the composition of

  abstract = {Dissociative recombination (DR) is a process in which a positive molecular
	ion recombines with an electron and subsequently dissociates into
	neutral fragments. Among the different types of molecular ion-electron

	it plays in low-temperature and low-density plasmas. Despite the
	apparent simplicity of the DR reaction, its investigation has proven
	to be a difficult task from both experimental and theoretical perspectives.
	In order to shed more light upon this process the storage ring technique
	has been introduced and utilised extensively for the last few decades.
	This thesis is devoted to experimental studies into the DR reaction
	at the storage ring CRYRING. The DR reaction has been investigated
	for the following molecular ions; Na+(D2O), PD2+, O3+, N3+, H2+,
	D2H+, OPCl+, OPCl2+ and H3O+, with the aim to ascertain rotational
	state effects, to find patterns in the branching products of similar

	reactions or transitions. The kinetic data associated with these
	reactions are manifested by superpositions of exponential decays
	that are often difficult to dissect. Two major challenges have hampered
	the kinetic analysis of multistep chemical reactions: (1) reliable
	and unbiased determination of the number of reaction steps, and (2)
	stable reconstruction of the distribution of kinetic rate constants.
	Here, we introduce two numerically stable integral transformations
	to solve these two challenges. The first transformation enables us
	to deduce the number of rate-limiting steps from kinetic measurements,
	even when each step has arbitrarily distributed rate constants. The
	second transformation allows us to reconstruct the distribution of
	rate constants in the multistep reaction using the phase function
	approach, without fitting the data. We demonstrate the stability
	of the two integral transformations by both analytic proofs and numerical
	tests. These new methods will help provide robust and unbiased kinetic
	analysis for many complex chemical and biochemical reactions.},

	(2D) model for Titan's stratosphere was constructed to systematically
	explore the physical mechanisms that produce and maintain stratospheric
	wind systems. To ensure conservation of angular momentum in the limit
	of no net exchange of atmospheric angular momentum with the solid
	satellite and no external sources and sinks, the zonal momentum equation
	was solved in flux form for total angular momentum. The relationships
	among thermal wind balance, meridional circulation, and zonal wind
	were examined with numerical experiments over a range of values for
	fundamental input parameters, including planetary rotation rate,
	radius, internal friction due to wave stresses, and net radiative
	drive. The magnitude of mid-latitude jets is most sensitive to a
	single parameter, the planetary rotation rate and results from the
	conversion of planetary angular momentum to relative angular momentum
	by the meridional circulation, whereas the strength of meridional
	circulation is mainly determined by the magnitude of the radiative
	drive. For Titan's slowly rotating atmosphere, the meridional temperature
	gradient is vanishingly small, even when the radiative drive is enhanced
	beyond reasonable magnitudes, and can be inferred from zonal winds
	in gradient/thermal wind balance. In our 2D model large equatorial
	superrotation in Titan's stratosphere can be only produced through
	internal drag forcing by eddy momentum fluxes, which redistribute
	angular momentum within the atmosphere, while still conserving the
	total angular momentum of the atmosphere with time. We cannot identify
	any waves, such as gravitational or thermal tides, that are sufficiently
	capable of generating the required eddy forcing of >50 m[thin space]s-1[thin
	space]Titan-day-1 to maintain peak prograde winds in excess of 100
	m[thin space]s-1 at the 1 mbar level.},

	Mars and outer solar system exploratory vehicle. Propulsion is provided
	by using a nuclear thermal reactor to heat a propellant volatile
	indigenous to the destination world to form a high thrust rocket
	exhaust. Candidate propellants whose performance, materials compatibility,
	and ease of acquisition are examd. include carbon dioxide, water,
	methane, nitrogen, carbon monoxide, and argon. Ballistic and winged
	supersonic configuration are discussed. The use of this method of
	propulsion potentially offers high payoff to a manned Mars mission,
	both by sharply reducing the initial mission mass required in low
	Earth orbit, and by providing Mars explorers with greatly enhanced
	mobility in traveling about the planet through the use of a vehicle
	that can refuel itself each time it lands. Using the nuclear landing
	craft in combination with a hydrogen fueled nuclear thermal interplanetary
	vehicle and a heavy lift booster, it is possible to achieve a manned
	Mars mission in one launch. Using such a system in the outer solar
	system, it is found that a low level aerial reconnaissance of Titan
	combined with a multiple sample return from nearly every satellite
	of Saturn can be accomplished in a single launch of a Titan IV or
	STS. [on SciFinder (R)]},
